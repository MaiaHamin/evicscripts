These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to the coordinates, on the Alabama coordinate system, of the triangulation and traverse stations of the United States coast and geodetic survey within the State of Alabama, as those coordinates have been determined by said survey.

Article 1. Alabama Coordinate System.
Ala.Code 1975 § 35-2-5
§ 35-2-5. Definition of system by United States coast and geodetic survey adopted.
Currentness


(a) For purposes of more precisely defining the Alabama coordinate system, the following definition by the United States coast and geodetic survey is adopted: The Alabama coordinate system, east zone, is a transverse Mercator projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having a central meridian 85° 50′ west from Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set one part in 25,000 too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 85° 50′ west longitude and the parallel 30° 30′ north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: x = 500,000 feet and y = 0 feet. The Alabama coordinate system, west zone, is a transverse Mercator projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having a central meridian 87° 30′ west from Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set one part in 15,000 too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 87° 30′ west longitude and the parallel 30° 00′ north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: x = 500,000 feet and y = 0 feet.
 

(b) The position of the Alabama coordinate system shall be as marked on the ground by triangulation or traverse stations established in conformity with standards adopted by the United States coast and geodetic survey for first-order and second-order work, whose geodetic positions have been rigidly adjusted on the North American Datum of 1927, and whose coordinates have been computed on the system herein defined. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection with the Alabama coordinate system.

Currentness


No coordinates based on the Alabama coordinate system, purporting to define the position of a point on a land boundary, shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless such point is within one-half mile of a triangulation or traverse station established in conformity with the standards prescribed in Section 35-2-5; provided, that said one-half mile limitation may be modified by the Secretary of State to meet local conditions. The Secretary of State shall, from time to time, procure descriptions of monuments, bench marks and markers, etc., as same may become available, relative to the Alabama coordinate system, and shall keep a complete record of this information in the office of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall make and furnish certified copies thereof to each of the probate judges of the several counties in Alabama. It shall be the duty of the probate judge of each county to file and keep a permanent record with proper indexes of such information which shall be available to the public.

(5) To collect and preserve information obtained from surveys made by those authorized to establish land monuments or land boundaries and to assist in the proper recording of the same by the duly constituted county officials, or otherwise;

When certified by the chief of the division of land surveys or a designated assistant, the records shall be admissible in evidence in any court in this state as the original record; and
 

(7) To prescribe and disseminate to those engaged in the business of land surveying, regulations designed to establish uniform professional surveying and mapping methods and standards in this state.

§ 35-4-8. Posthumous children included in “heirs,” “issue,” or “children.”
Currentness


Where a future estate is limited to “heirs,” “issue,” or “children,” posthumous children are entitled to take the estate in the same manner as if born before the death of the parent. Any future estate depending upon the death of a person without heirs, issue, or children is defeated by the birth of a posthumous child of such person capable of taking by descent.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the acknowledgment of any instrument executed outside the State of Alabama which is in compliance with the manner and form prescribed by the laws of the place of its execution, is executed in a state, territory, or insular possession of the United States or the District of Columbia, and is verified by the official seal of the officer before whom it is acknowledged, shall have the same effect as an acknowledgment in the manner and form prescribed by the laws of this state for instruments executed within the state.
