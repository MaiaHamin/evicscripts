(ii) Negotiates with the buyer to place the home in a park.

(b) If subsection (a) of this section does not apply, the seller shall provide the buyer with a notice, in writing, separate from the contract, and in substantially the following form:
 

“If the mobile home you are purchasing is to be placed in a mobile home park, the park may have rules and lease provisions that affect you and your home.
 

You should contact the park office to obtain and carefully review a copy of the lease and rules for the park before you enter into a contract to purchase a mobile home.
 

Due to land use restrictions in many areas in this State, a mobile home may be placed only on property that is within a mobile home park.”

Effective: June 1, 2015
Currentness

Amount of security deposit

(a)(1) A park owner may not impose a security deposit in excess of the equivalent of 2 months’ rent, or $50, whichever is greater. If a security deposit exceeds this amount, the resident may recover up to threefold the extra money charged, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.
 

(2)(i) After receiving payment of the initial security deposit from the resident, a park owner may not increase the security deposit.
 

(ii) If the resident was not required to pay a security deposit during a prior lease or rental term, a park owner may not impose a security deposit.
 
Limitations

(b) An action under this section may be brought at any time during the tenancy or within 2 years after its termination.
 
Written receipts for security deposits

(c)(1) The park owner shall give the resident a receipt for the security deposit.
 

(2) The receipt may be included in a written rental agreement.
 

(3) The park owner shall be liable to the resident in the sum of $25 if the park owner fails to provide a written receipt for the security deposit.
 

(4) The receipt or rental agreement shall contain language informing the resident of his rights under this section to receive from the park owner a written list of all existing damages if the resident makes a written request of the park owner within 15 days of the resident’s occupancy.
 
Written list of existing damages

(d)(1) If the park owner imposes a security deposit, on written request, he promptly shall provide the resident with a written list of all existing damages. The request must be made within 15 days of the resident’s occupancy.
 

(2) Failure to provide the resident with this written statement renders the park owner liable to the resident for threefold the amount of the security deposit. The total amount of damages shall be subject to a setoff for damages and unpaid rent which reasonably could be withheld under this section.
 
Accounts for security deposits

(e)(1) The park owner shall maintain all security deposits in a banking or savings institution in the State. This account shall be devoted exclusively to security deposits and bear interest.
 

(2) A security deposit shall be deposited in the account within 30 days after the park owner receives it.
 

(3) In the event of sales or transfer of any sort, including receivership or bankruptcy, the security deposit is binding on the successor in interest to the person to whom the deposit is given. Security deposits are free from any attachment by creditors.
 

(4) Any successor in interest is liable to the resident for failure to return the security deposit, together with interest, as provided in this section.
 
Return of security deposit with interest

(f)(1) Within 45 days after the end of the tenancy, the park owner shall return the security deposit to the resident together with simple interest which has accrued at the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve rate for 1 year, as of the first business day of each year, or 1.5% a year, whichever is greater, less any damages rightfully withheld.
 

(2)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, interest shall accrue at monthly intervals from the day the resident gives the park owner the security deposit. Interest is not compounded.
 

(ii) No interest is due or payable:
 

1. Unless the park owner has held the security deposit for at least 6 months; or
 

2. For any period less than a full month.
 

(3) Interest shall be payable only on security deposits of $50 or more.
 

(4) If the park owner, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, the resident has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.
 
Grounds for withholding security deposits

(g)(1) The security deposit, or any portion of the security deposit, may be withheld for unpaid rent, damage due to breach of the rental agreement, or damage to the leased premises by the resident or the resident’s family, agents, employees, or social guests in excess of ordinary wear and tear.
 

(2) The resident has the right to be present when the park owner or his agent inspects the premises in order to determine if any damage was done to the premises, if the resident notifies the park owner in writing of his intention to move, the date of moving and his new address. The notice to be furnished by the resident to the park owner shall be mailed at least 15 days prior to the date of moving. Upon receipt of the notice, the park owner shall notify the resident in writing of the time and date when the premises are to be inspected. The date of inspection shall occur within 5 days after the moving as designated in the resident’s notice. The resident shall be advised of his rights under this subsection in writing which may be included in the rental agreement at the time of his payment of the security deposit. Failure by the park owner to comply with this requirement forfeits the right of the park owner to withhold any part of the security deposit for damages.
 
Reliance on list of yield curve rates or customized calculator

(h) A park owner is entitled to rely on the list of yield curve rates or the customized calculator maintained by the Department of Housing and Community Development under § 8-203(k) of this article when calculating the interest on a security deposit.

(ii) Arbitrarily increase the rent or decrease the services to which a resident has been entitled; or
 

(iii) Terminate a periodic tenancy.
 

(2) A park owner may not take an action that is listed under paragraph (1) of this subsection for any of the following reasons:

1. The park owner; or

(ii) Because the resident or the resident’s agent has:
 

1. Filed a lawsuit against the park owner; or

Construction with other laws

(f) If any county has enacted or enacts an ordinance comparable in subject matter to this section, this section shall supersede the provisions of the ordinance to the extent that the ordinance provides less protection to a resident.

§ 8A-1502. Fairness of rental agreements or rules and uniform application of park rules
Currentness

Determinations relating to conscionability of rental agreements or park rules

(a) If it is claimed or appears to the court that a rental agreement or park rule may be unconscionable, the court may give to the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the meaning of the rental agreement or park rule, relationship of the parties, purpose, and other relevant factors to aid the court in making a determination.
 
Park rules not applied uniformly to residents

(b) A park rule that does not apply uniformly to all residents in a park creates a rebuttable presumption of unfairness.
 
Factors considered by court in determination

(c) In determining if a provision of a rental agreement or of a park rule is unconscionable the court may consider if the provision:
 

(1) Promotes the convenience, safety, or welfare of residents;
 

(2) Preserves from abusive use property of the park owner;
 

(3) Promotes a fair distribution of services or facilities held out to residents generally;
 

(4) Relates reasonably to its purpose;
 

(5) Applies to all residents in a fair manner;
 

(6) Are sufficiently explicit for a resident to comply; and
 

(7) Is for the purpose of evading an obligation of the park owner.
 
Rental agreements or park rules found unconscionable

(d) If a court finds that any provision of a rental agreement or park rule is unconscionable, the court may:
 

(1) Refuse to enforce the rental agreement or park rule;
 

(2) Enforce the remainder of the rental agreement or park rule without the unconscionable provision; or
 

(3) Limit the application of any unconscionable provision as to avoid any unconscionable result.
 
Indemnification provisions against public policy

(e) If the effect of any provision of a rental agreement is to indemnify the park owner, hold him harmless, or preclude or exonerate him from any liability to a mobile home resident, or to any other person, for any injury, loss, damage, or liability arising from any omission, fault, negligence, or other misconduct of the park owner on or about the leased premises not within the exclusive control of the mobile home resident, the provision is against public policy and void. An insurer may not claim a right of subrogation by reason of the invalidity of this provision.

(2) Any other legal or equitable defense.
 
Trustees to receive rent payments

MD Code, Real Property, § 8A-1701
§ 8A-1701. Repossession of premises
Currentness

Failure of resident to pay rent

(a) Whenever the resident under any rental agreement, express or implied, verbal or written, shall fail to pay the rent when due and payable, it shall be lawful for the park owner to have again and repossess the premises so rented.
 
Written complaints before District Court

(b) Whenever any park owner shall desire to repossess any premises to which he is entitled, he or his duly qualified agent or attorney, shall make his written complaint under oath or affirmation, before the District Court of the county wherein the property is situated, describing in general terms the property sought to be repossessed, and also setting forth the name of the resident to whom the property is rented or his assignee or subtenant with the amount of rent due and unpaid; and praying by warrant to repossess the premises, together with judgment for the amount of rent due and costs. The District Court shall issue its summons, directed to any constable or sheriff of the county entitled to serve process, and ordering him to notify by first-class mail the tenant, assignee, or subtenant to appear before the District Court at the trial to be held on the fifth day after the filing of the complaint, to answer the park owner’s complaint to show cause why the prayer of the park owner should not be granted, and the constable or sheriff shall proceed to serve the summons upon the resident, assignee, or subtenant in the property or upon his known or authorized agent, but if for any reason, neither the resident, assignee, or subtenant, nor his agent, can be found, then the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously upon the mobile home. The affixing of the summons upon the mobile home after due notification to the resident, assignee, or subtenant by first-class mail shall conclusively be presumed to be a sufficient service to all persons to support the entry of a default judgment for possession of the premises, together with court costs, in favor of the park owner, but it shall not be sufficient service to support a default judgment in favor of the park owner for the amount of rent due.
 
Judgments, orders from court to surrender premises, and satisfaction of rent

(c)(1) If, at the trial on the fifth day indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the court is satisfied that the interests of justice will be better served by an adjournment to enable either party to procure his necessary witnesses, he may adjourn the trial for a period not exceeding 1 day, except that if the consent of all parties is obtained, the trial may be adjourned for a longer period of time.
 

(2) If, when the trial occurs, it appears to the satisfaction of the court, that the rent, or any part of the rent, is actually due and unpaid, the court shall determine the amount of rent due and enter a judgment in favor of the park owner for possession of the premises. The court may also give judgment in favor of the park owner for the amount of rent determined to be due together with costs of the suit if the court finds that the actual service of process made on the defendant would have been sufficient to support a judgment in an action in contract or tort.
 

(3) The court, when entering the judgment, shall also order the resident to yield and render possession of the premises to the park owner, or his agent or attorney, within 30 days after the trial.
 

(4) The court may, upon presentation of a certificate signed by a physician certifying that surrender of the premises within this 30-day period would endanger the health or life of the resident or any other occupant of the premises, extend the time for surrender of the premises as justice may require. However, the court may not extend the time for the surrender of the premises beyond 45 days after the trial.
 

(5) However, if the resident, or someone for him, at the trial, or adjournment of the trial, tenders to the park owner the rent determined by the court to be due and unpaid, together with the costs of the suit, the complaint against the resident shall be entered as being satisfied.
 
Failure of resident to comply with court order

(d) If judgment is given in favor of the park owner, and the resident fails to comply with the requirements of the order within 15 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 15 days, issue its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering him to cause the park owner to have again and repossess the property by putting him (or his duly qualified agent or attorney for his benefit) in possession thereof, and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, the mobile home and all additions or attachments of every description whatsoever belonging to the resident, or to any person claiming or holding by or under said resident. If the park owner does not order a warrant of restitution within 60 days from the date of judgment or from the expiration date of any stay of execution, whichever shall be the later, the judgment for possession shall be stricken.
 
Resident right of redemption of leased premises

(e) In any action of summary ejectment for failure to pay rent where the park owner is awarded a judgment giving him restitution of the leased premises, the resident shall have the right to redemption of the leased premises by tendering in cash, certified check, or money order to the park owner or his agent all past due rent and late fees, plus all court awarded costs and fees, at any time before actual execution of the eviction order. This subsection does not apply to any resident against whom 3 judgments of possession have been entered for rent due and unpaid in the 12 months prior to the initiation of the action to which this subsection otherwise would apply.
 
Appeals

(f) The resident or the park owner may appeal from the judgment of the District Court to the circuit court for any county at any time within 2 days from the rendition of the judgment. The resident, in order to stay any execution of the judgment, shall give a bond to the park owner with one or more sureties, who are owners of sufficient property in the State of Maryland, with condition to prosecute the appeal with effect, and answer to the park owner in all costs and damages mentioned in the judgment, and such other damages as shall be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal. The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the park owner to proceed against the resident, assignee, or subtenant for any and all rents that may become due and payable to the park owner after the rendition of the judgment.

§ 8A-1702. Liability of residents for unlawful hold overs
Currentness

In general

(a)(1) A resident under any lease or someone holding under him, who shall unlawfully hold over beyond the termination of the rental agreement, shall be liable to the park owner for the actual damages caused by the holding over.
 

(2) The damages awarded to a park owner against the resident or someone holding under him, may not be less than the apportioned rent for the period of holdover at the rate under the rental agreement.
 

(3) Any action to recover damages under this section may be brought by suit separate from the eviction or removal proceeding or in the same action and in any court having jurisdiction over the amount in issue.
 

(4) Nothing contained herein is intended to limit any other remedies which a park owner may have against a holdover resident under the rental agreement or under applicable law.
 
Notice and complaint, summons, and hearing

(b)(1) Where any interest in property shall be leased for any definite term or at will, and the park owner shall desire to repossess the property after the expiration of the term for which it was leased and shall give notice in writing 1 month before the expiration of the term or determination of the will to the resident or to the person actually in possession of the property to remove from the property at the end of the term, and if the resident or person in actual possession shall refuse to comply, the park owner may make complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the property is located. The court shall issue its summons to the resident or person in possession that he appear on a day stated in the summons before the court to show cause (if any he have) why restitution of the possession of the estate leased should not be made to the park owner. Upon the failure of either of the parties to appear before the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not less than 6 nor more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the parties of the continuance.
 

(2) If upon hearing the parties, or in case the resident or person in possession shall neglect to appear after the summons and continuance the court shall find that the park owner had been in possession of the leased property, that the said lease or estate is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the resident or person in possession and that he had refused so to do, the court shall thereupon give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective counties commanding him forthwith to deliver to the park owner possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the park owner was possessed of the same at the time when the leasing was made, and shall give judgment for costs against the resident or person in possession so holding over. Either party shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the circuit court for the county within ten days from the judgment. If the resident appeals and files with the District Court an affidavit that the appeal is not taken for delay, and also a good and sufficient bond with one or more securities conditioned that he will prosecute the appeal with effect and well and truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the appellate court and all loss or damage which the park owner may suffer by reason of the resident’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time he shall so hold over, then the resident or person in possession of said premises may retain possession thereof until the determination of said appeal. The appellate court shall, upon application of either party, set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 nor more than 15 days after the application, and notice for the order for a hearing shall be served on the opposite party or his counsel at least 5 days before the hearing. If the judgment of the District Court shall be in favor of the park owner, a warrant shall be issued by the appellate court to the sheriff, who shall proceed forthwith to execute the warrant.
 

(3) The provisions of this section shall apply to all cases of tenancies from year to year, tenancies of the month and by the week. In case of tenancies from year to year, notice in writing shall be given 3 months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy, and in monthly or weekly tenancies, a notice in writing of 1 month, shall be so given; and the same proceeding shall apply, so far as may be, to cases of forcible entry and detainer.
 

(4) When the resident shall give notice by parole to the park owner or to his agent or representatives, at least 1 month before the expiration of the lease or tenancy in all cases except in cases of tenancies from year to year, and at least 3 months’ notice in all cases of tenancy from year to year, of the intention of the tenant to remove at the end of that year and to surrender possession of the property at that time, and the park owner, his agent, or representative shall prove the notice from the resident by competent testimony, it shall not be necessary for the park owner, his agent or representative to provide a written notice to the resident, but the proof of such notice from the resident as aforesaid shall entitle the park owner to recover possession of the property hereunder.

§ 8A-1703. Repossession of premises upon breach of rental agreement
Currentness

Notice, complaint, and summons

(a) When a rental agreement provides that the park owner may repossess the premises if the resident breaches the rental agreement, and the park owner has given the resident 1 month’s written notice that the resident is in violation of the rental agreement and the park owner desires to repossess the premises, and if the resident or person in actual possession refuses to comply, the park owner may make complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the premises is located. The court shall summons immediately the resident or person in possession to appear before the court on a day stated in the summons to show cause, if any, why restitution of the possession of the leased premises should not be made to the park owner. If either of the parties fails to appear before the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than 6 nor more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
 
Determination of breach of rental agreement

(b) If the court determines that the resident breached the terms of the rental agreement and that the breach warrants an eviction, the court shall give judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable commanding him to deliver possession to the park owner in as full and ample manner as the park owner was possessed of the same at the time when the rental agreement was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the resident or person in possession. Either party may appeal to the circuit court for the county within 10 days from entry of the judgment. If the resident (1) files with the District Court an affidavit that the appeal is not taken for delay; (2) files sufficient bond with one or more securities conditioned upon diligent prosecution of the appeal; (3) pays all rent in arrears, all court costs in the case; and (4) pays all losses or damages which the park owner may suffer by reason of the resident’s holding over, the resident or person in possession of the premises may retain possession until the determination of the appeal. Upon application of either party, the court shall set a day for the hearing of the appeal not less than 5 nor more than 15 days after the application, and notice of the order for a hearing shall be served on the other party or his counsel at least 5 days before the hearing. If the judgment of the District Court is in favor of the park owner, a warrant shall be issued by the court which hears the appeal to the sheriff, who shall execute the warrant.
