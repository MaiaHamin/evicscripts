§ 8-107. Statute of limitations
Currentness


If there is no demand or payment for more than 20 consecutive years of any specific rent reserved out of a particular property or any part of a particular property under any form of lease, the rent conclusively is presumed to be extinguished and the landlord may not set up any claim for the rent or to the reversion in the property out of which it issued. The landlord also may not institute any suit, action, or proceeding to recover the rent or the property. However, if the landlord is under any legal disability when the period of 20 years of nondemand or nonpayment expires, the landlord has two years after the removal of the disability within which to assert the landlord’s rights.

(f) As long as a landlord’s termination of a tenancy is not the result of a retaliatory action, nothing in this section may be interpreted to alter the landlord’s or the tenant’s rights to terminate or not renew a tenancy.
 
Construction with comparable ordinances

(g) If any county has enacted or enacts an ordinance comparable in subject matter to this section, this section shall supersede the provisions of the ordinance to the extent that the ordinance provides less protection to a tenant.

Title 8. Landlord and Tenant (Refs & Annos)
Subtitle 2. Residential Leases (Refs & Annos)
MD Code, Real Property, § 8-211
§ 8-211. Duty of landlords to repair or eliminate serious conditions and defects of residential dwelling units
Currentness

Purpose of section

(a) The purpose of this section is to provide tenants with a mechanism for encouraging the repair of serious and dangerous defects which exist within or as part of any residential dwelling unit, or upon the property used in common of which the dwelling unit forms a part. The defects sought to be reached by this section are those which present a substantial and serious threat of danger to the life, health and safety of the occupants of the dwelling unit, and not those which merely impair the aesthetic value of the premises, or which are, in those locations governed by such codes, housing code violations of a nondangerous nature. The intent of this section is not to provide a remedy for dangerous conditions in the community at large which exists apart from the leased premises or the property in common of which the leased premises forms a part.
 
Public policy of Maryland

(b) It is the public policy of Maryland that meaningful sanctions be imposed upon those who allow dangerous conditions and defects to exist in leased premises, and that an effective mechanism be established for repairing these conditions and halting their creation.
 
Application of section to residential dwelling units

(c) This section applies to residential dwelling units leased for the purpose of human habitation within the State of Maryland. This section does not apply to farm tenancies.
 
Application to publicly or privately owned, single or multiple dwelling units

(d) This section applies to all applicable dwelling units whether they are (1) publicly or privately owned or (2) single or multiple units.
 
Failure of landlords to repair or eliminate serious conditions and defects

(e) This section provides a remedy and imposes an obligation upon landlords to repair and eliminate conditions and defects which constitute, or if not promptly corrected will constitute, a fire hazard or a serious and substantial threat to the life, health or safety of occupants, including, but not limited to:
 

(1) Lack of heat, light, electricity, or hot or cold running water, except where the tenant is responsible for the payment of the utilities and the lack thereof is the direct result of the tenant’s failure to pay the charges;
 

(2) Lack of adequate sewage disposal facilities;
 

(3) Infestation of rodents in two or more dwelling units;
 

(4) The existence of any structural defect which presents a serious and substantial threat to the physical safety of the occupants; or
 

(5) The existence of any condition which presents a health or fire hazard to the dwelling unit.
 
Failure to repair and eliminate minor defects

(f) This section does not provide a remedy for the landlord’s failure to repair and eliminate minor defects or, in those locations governed by such codes, housing code violations of a nondangerous nature. There is a rebuttable presumption that the following conditions, when they do not present a serious and substantial threat to the life, health and safety of the occupants, are not covered by this section:
 

(1) Any defect which merely reduces the aesthetic value of the leased premises, such as the lack of fresh paint, rugs, carpets, paneling or other decorative amenities;
 

(2) Small cracks in the walls, floors or ceilings;
 

(3) The absence of linoleum or tile upon the floors, provided that they are otherwise safe and structurally sound; or
 

(4) The absence of air conditioning.
 
Notice of defects or conditions

(g) In order to employ the remedies provided by this section, the tenant shall notify the landlord of the existence of the defects or conditions. Notice shall be given by (1) a written communication sent by certified mail listing the asserted conditions or defects, or (2) actual notice of the defects or conditions, or (3) a written violation, condemnation or other notice from an appropriate State, county, municipal or local government agency stating the asserted conditions or defects.
 
Reasonable time for landlord to repair or correct conditions

(h) The landlord has a reasonable time after receipt of notice in which to make the repairs or correct the conditions. The length of time deemed to be reasonable is a question of fact for the court, taking into account the severity of the defects or conditions and the danger which they present to the occupants. There is a rebuttable presumption that a period in excess of 30 days from receipt of notice is unreasonable.
 
Actions of rent escrow

(i) If the landlord refuses to make the repairs or correct the conditions, or if after a reasonable time the landlord has failed to do so, the tenant may bring an action of rent escrow to pay rent into court because of the asserted defects or conditions, or the tenant may refuse to pay rent and raise the existence of the asserted defects or conditions as an affirmative defense to an action for distress for rent or to any complaint proceeding brought by the landlord to recover rent or the possession of the leased premises.
 
Requests for relief

(j)(1) Whether the issue of rent escrow is raised affirmatively or defensively, the tenant may request one or more of the forms of relief set forth in this section.
 

(2) In addition to any other relief sought, if within 90 days after the court finds that the conditions complained of by the tenant exist the landlord has not made the repairs or corrected the conditions complained of, the tenant may file a petition of injunction in the District Court requesting the court to order the landlord to make the repairs or correct the conditions.
 
Conditions for relief

(k) Relief under this section is conditioned upon:
 

(1) Giving proper notice, and where appropriate, the opportunity to correct, as described by subsection (h) of this section.
 

(2) Payment by the tenant, into court, of the amount of rent required by the lease, unless this amount is modified by the court as provided in subsection (m) of this section.
 

(3) In the case of tenancies measured by a period of one month or more, the court having not entered against the tenant 3 prior judgments of possession for rent due and unpaid in the 12-month period immediately prior to the initiation of the action by the tenant or by the landlord.
 

(4) In the case of periodic tenancies measured by the weekly payment of rent, the court having not entered against the tenant more than 5 judgments of possession for rent due and unpaid in the 12-month period immediately prior to the initiation of the action by the tenant or by the landlord, or, if the tenant has lived on the premises six months or less, the court having not entered against the tenant 3 judgments of possession for rent due and unpaid.
 
Defense to allegations of tenant

(l) It is a sufficient defense to the allegations of the tenant that the tenant, the tenant’s family, agent, employees, or assignees or social guests have caused the asserted defects or conditions, or that the landlord or the landlord’s agents were denied reasonable and appropriate entry for the purpose of correcting or repairing the asserted conditions or defects.
 
Court findings and orders

(m) The court shall make appropriate findings of fact and make any order that the justice of the case may require, including any one or a combination of the following:
 

(1) Order the termination of the lease and return of the leased premises to the landlord, subject to the tenant’s right of redemption;
 

(2) Order that the action for rent escrow be dismissed;
 

(3) Order that the amount of rent required by the lease, whether paid into court or to the landlord, be abated and reduced in an amount determined by the court to be fair and equitable to represent the existence of the conditions or defects found by the court to exist; or
 

(4) Order the landlord to make the repairs or correct the conditions complained of by the tenant and found by the court to exist.
 
Distribution of escrow account funds

(n) After rent escrow has been established, the court:
 

(1) Shall, after a hearing, if so ordered by the court or one is requested by the landlord, order that the money in the escrow account be disbursed to the landlord after the necessary repairs have been made;
 

(2) May, after an appropriate hearing, order that some or all money in the escrow account be paid to the landlord or the landlord’s agent, the tenant or the tenant’s agent, or any other appropriate person or agency for the purpose of making the necessary repairs of the dangerous conditions or defects;
 

(3) May, after a hearing if one is requested by the landlord, appoint a special administrator who shall cause the repairs to be made, and who shall apply to the court to pay for them out of the money in the escrow account;
 

(4) May, after an appropriate hearing, order that some or all money in the escrow account be disbursed to pay any mortgage or deed of trust on the property in order to stay a foreclosure;
 

(5) May, after a hearing, if one is requested by the tenant, order, if no repairs are made or if no good faith effort to repair is made within six months of the initial decision to place money in the escrow account, that the money in the escrow account be disbursed to the tenant. Such an order will not discharge the right on the part of the tenant to pay rent into court and an appeal will stay the forfeiture; or
 

(6) May, after an appropriate hearing, order that the money in the escrow account be disbursed to the landlord if the tenant does not regularly pay, into that account, the rent owed.
 
Construction with local ordinances

Petition for exclusion of goods

(a) Within seven days after the levy, any person who is not a tenant and whose goods are levied on under distress may file a petition with the court where the action of distress is pending for an order to exclude from levy the goods of the person not a tenant. The petition shall set forth the facts as to the ownership of the goods and shall be verified by the petitioner.
 
Service of petition

(b) A copy of the petition shall be served on the plaintiff and defendant. If service cannot be made on either, the petitioner shall certify this fact to the court in writing, stating the reason for it.
 
Orders excluding goods from levy

(c) After a hearing held on not more than ten days’ notice, and on submission of proof satisfactory to the court that the goods are not the property of the tenant, the court shall issue an order excluding the goods from levy. This order authorizes the owner to remove the owner’s goods from the leased premises at the owner’s expense free of any claim of the landlord.
 
Removal of excluded goods

(d) The order shall provide that the claimant shall remove the claimant’s goods at the claimant’s expense from the leased premises within a time to be fixed by the court. If the claimant fails to remove the claimant’s goods within the fixed time, then the goods claimed by the claimant no longer shall be excluded from distress and shall be subject to the landlord’s claim for distress as though no petition for exclusion had been filed.
 
Finality of levy

(e) If no petition to determine ownership of goods is filed by any third person within seven days after the date of a levy under distress, all goods on the leased premises and included in the inventory conclusively are presumed to be the goods of the tenant and may be disposed of according to the applicable provisions of this subtitle without any liability to the owner for the disposal.

§ 8-328. Death of tenant
Currentness

Actions of distress against tenant regardless of death or nonexistence

(a) If a tenant under a lease dies, or, if the tenant is a corporation and ceases to exist, distress may be brought against the tenant named in the lease regardless of death or nonexistence. The plaintiff shall give notice of an action of distress to the personal representative of a deceased defendant or to any person who was an officer at the time the corporation ceased to exist and the plaintiff shall certify to the court that the plaintiff has given notice. Then the plaintiff may proceed with levy and sale as provided in this subtitle.
 
Notice of sale posted on courthouse door

(b) If a tenant dies and no personal representative is appointed by a court having jurisdiction, or if an officer of the nonexistent corporation cannot be found and, therefore, service of process is returned non est, then, on application of the plaintiff, an order may be passed requiring a copy of the petition for distress to be posted at the courthouse door at least one week before the date of sale. Failure of the plaintiff to apply for the order subjects the plaintiff to suit by the personal representative of the deceased tenant, or by the officer or surviving directors of the nonexistent corporation for any loss or damage sustained. If the plaintiff makes application for the order, the plaintiff is under no liability either to the estate of the deceased tenant, or to the surviving trustees or officers of the nonexistent corporation.

The obligation of the assignee of the lease for personal liability shall be restricted to the terms and agreements contained in the assignment of lease. The exercise of any right of the landlord against the assignee provided in this section does not bar any rights the landlord may have against the assignor.

(iv) Requesting to repossess the premises and, if requested by the landlord, a judgment for the amount of rent due, costs, and any late fees, less the amount of any utility bills, fees, or security deposits paid by a tenant under § 7-309 of the Public Utilities Article;
 

(v) If applicable, stating that, to the best of the landlord’s knowledge, the tenant is deceased, intestate, and without next of kin; and
 

(vi) If the property to be repossessed is an affected property as defined in § 6-801 of the Environment Article, stating that the landlord has registered the affected property as required under § 6-811 of the Environment Article and renewed the registration as required under § 6-812 of the Environment Article and:

A. The owner has requested that the tenant allow the owner access to the property to perform the work required under Title 6, Subtitle 8 of the Environment Article;
 

B. The owner has offered to relocate the tenant in order to allow the owner to perform work if the work will disturb the paint on the interior surfaces of the property and to pay the reasonable expenses the tenant would incur directly related to the relocation; and
 

C. The tenant has refused to allow access to the owner or refused to vacate the property in order for the owner to perform the required work.
 

(2) For the purpose of the court’s determination under subsection (c) of this section the landlord shall also specify the amount of rent due for each rental period under the lease, the day that the rent is due for each rental period, and any late fees for overdue rent payments.

2. If personal service is requested and none of the persons whom the sheriff is directed to serve shall be found on the property and, in all cases where personal service is not requested, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously upon the property.
 

(ii) The affixing of the summons upon the property after due notification to the tenant, assignee, or subtenant by first-class mail shall conclusively be presumed to be a sufficient service to all persons to support the entry of a default judgment for possession of the premises, together with court costs, in favor of the landlord, but it shall not be sufficient service to support a default judgment in favor of the landlord for the amount of rent due.
 

(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subsection:

A. If any of the persons whom the sheriff is directed to serve are found on the property or at another known address, the sheriff shall serve any such persons; or
 

B. If none of the persons whom the sheriff is directed to serve are found on the property or at another known address, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously upon the property.
 

2. The affixing of the summons upon the property shall conclusively be presumed to be a sufficient service to all persons to support the entry of a default judgment for possession of the premises, together with court costs, in favor of the landlord, but it shall not be sufficient service to support a default judgment in favor of the landlord for the amount of rent due.
 
Adjournments to procure witnesses

(c)(1) If, at the trial on the fifth day indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the court is satisfied that the interests of justice will be better served by an adjournment to enable either party to procure their necessary witnesses, the court may adjourn the trial for a period not exceeding 1 day, except with the consent of all parties, the trial may be adjourned for a longer period of time.
 

(2)(i) The information required under subsection (b)(1)(vi) of this section may not be an issue of fact in a trial under this section.
 

(ii) If, when the trial occurs, it appears to the satisfaction of the court, that the rent, or any part of the rent and late fees are actually due and unpaid, the court shall determine the amount of rent and late fees due as of the date the complaint was filed less the amount of any utility bills, fees, or security deposits paid by a tenant under § 7-309 of the Public Utilities Article, if the trial occurs within the time specified by subsection (b)(3) of this section.
 

(iii) 1. If the trial does not occur within the time specified in subsection (b)(3)(i) of this section and the tenant has not become current since the filing of the complaint, the court, if the complaint so requests, shall enter a judgment in favor of the landlord for possession of the premises and determine the rent and late fees due as of the trial date.
 

2. The determination of rent and late fees shall include the following:
 

A. Rent claimed in the complaint;
 

B. Rent accruing after the date of the filing of the complaint;
 

C. Late fees accruing in or prior to the month in which the complaint was filed; and
 

D. Credit for payments of rent and late fees and other fees, utility bills, or security deposits paid by a tenant under § 7-309 of the Public Utilities Article after the complaint was filed.
 

(iv) In the case of a residential tenancy, the court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for the amount of rent and late fees determined to be due together with costs of the suit if the court finds that the residential tenant was personally served with a summons.
 

(v) In the case of a nonresidential tenancy, if the court finds that there was such service of process or submission to the jurisdiction of the court as would support a judgment in contract or tort, the court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for:
 

1. The amount of rent and late fees determined to be due;
 

2. Costs of the suit; and
 

3. Reasonable attorney’s fees, if the lease agreement authorizes the landlord to recover attorney’s fees.
 

(vi) A nonresidential tenant who was not personally served with a summons shall not be subject to personal jurisdiction of the court if that tenant asserts that the appearance is for the purpose of defending an in rem action prior to the time that evidence is taken by the court.
 

(3) The court, when entering the judgment, shall also order that possession of the premises be given to the landlord, or the landlord’s agent or attorney, within 4 days after the trial.
 

(4) The court may, upon presentation of a certificate signed by a physician certifying that surrender of the premises within this 4-day period would endanger the health or life of the tenant or any other occupant of the premises, extend the time for surrender of the premises as justice may require but not more than 15 days after the trial.
 

(5) However, if the tenant, or someone for the tenant, at the trial, or adjournment of the trial, tenders to the landlord the rent and late fees determined by the court to be due and unpaid, together with the costs of the suit, the complaint against the tenant shall be entered as being satisfied.
 
Removal of tenant for noncompliance with judgment

(d)(1)(i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if judgment is given in favor of the landlord, and the tenant fails to comply with the requirements of the order within 4 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 4 days, issue its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the landlord (or the landlord’s duly qualified agent or attorney for the landlord’s benefit) in possession thereof, and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, all the furniture, implements, tools, goods, effects or other chattels of every description whatsoever belonging to the tenant, or to any person claiming or holding by or under said tenant.
 

(ii) If the landlord does not order a warrant of restitution within sixty days from the date of judgment or from the expiration date of any stay of execution, whichever shall be the later:
 

1. The judgment for possession shall be stricken; and
 

2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established in subsection (e)(2) of this section unless the court in its discretion determines that the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection (e)(2) of this section.
 

(iii) If the landlord orders a warrant of restitution but takes no action on the warrant within 60 days from the later of the date the court issues the order for the warrant or the date as otherwise extended by the court:
 

1. The warrant of restitution shall expire and the judgment for possession shall be stricken; and
 

2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established in subsection (e)(2) of this section unless the court in its discretion determines that the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection (e)(2) of this section.
 

(2)(i) The administrative judge of any district may stay the execution of a warrant of restitution of a residential property, from day to day, in the event of extreme weather conditions.
 

(ii) When a stay has been granted under this paragraph, the execution of the warrant of restitution for which the stay has been granted shall be given priority and completed within 3 days after the extreme weather conditions cease.
 
Tenant’s right to redeem leased premises

(e)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, in any action of summary ejectment for failure to pay rent where the landlord is awarded a judgment giving the landlord restitution of the leased premises, the tenant shall have the right to redemption of the leased premises by tendering in cash, certified check or money order to the landlord or the landlord’s agent all past due amounts, as determined by the court under subsection (c) of this section, plus all court awarded costs and fees, at any time before actual execution of the eviction order.
 

(2) This subsection does not apply to any tenant against whom 3 judgments of possession have been entered for rent due and unpaid in the 12 months prior to the initiation of the action to which this subsection otherwise would apply.
 
Appeals

(f)(1) The tenant or the landlord may appeal from the judgment of the District Court to the circuit court for any county at any time within 4 days from the rendition of the judgment.
 

(2) The tenant, in order to stay any execution of the judgment, shall give a bond to the landlord with one or more sureties, who are owners of sufficient property in the State of Maryland, with condition to prosecute the appeal with effect, and answer to the landlord in all costs and damages mentioned in the judgment, and other damages as shall be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
 

(3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to proceed against the tenant, assignee or subtenant for any and all rents that may become due and payable to the landlord after the rendition of the judgment.

§ 8-402. Tenant hold overs
Effective: March 14, 2016
Currentness

Liability of tenant for damages

(a)(1) A tenant under any periodic tenancy, or at the expiration of a lease, and someone holding under the tenant, who shall unlawfully hold over beyond the expiration of the lease or termination of the tenancy, shall be liable to the landlord for the actual damages caused by the holding over.
 

(2) The damages awarded to a landlord against the tenant or someone holding under the tenant, may not be less than the apportioned rent for the period of holdover at the rate under the lease.
 

(3)(i) Any action to recover damages under this section may be brought by suit separate from the eviction or removal proceeding or in the same action and in any court having jurisdiction over the amount in issue.
 

(ii) The court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for the damages determined to be due together with costs of the suit if the court finds that the residential tenant was personally served with a summons, or, in the case of a nonresidential tenancy, there was such service of process or submission to the jurisdiction of the court as would support a judgment in contract or tort.
 

(iii) A nonresidential tenant who was not personally served with a summons shall not be subject to personal jurisdiction of the court if that tenant asserts that the appearance is for the purpose of defending an in rem action prior to the time that evidence is taken by the court.
 

(4) Nothing contained herein is intended to limit any other remedies which a landlord may have against a holdover tenant under the lease or under applicable law.
 
Notice to quit tenancy

(b)(1)(i) Where any tenancy is for any definite term or at will, and the landlord shall desire to repossess the property after the expiration of the term for which it was leased and shall give notice in writing one month before the expiration of the term or determination of the will to the tenant or to the person actually in possession of the property to remove from the property at the end of the term, and if the tenant or person in actual possession shall refuse to comply, the landlord may make complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the property is located.
 

(ii) 1. The court shall issue a summons directed to any constable or sheriff of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the constable or sheriff to notify the tenant, assignee, or subtenant to appear on a day stated in the summons before the court to show cause why restitution should not be made to the landlord.
 

2. The constable or sheriff shall serve the summons on the tenant, assignee, or subtenant on the property, or on the known or authorized agent of the tenant, assignee, or subtenant.
 

3. If, for any reason those persons cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously on the property.
 

4. After notice to the tenant, assignee, or subtenant by first-class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
 

(iii) Upon the failure of either of the parties to appear before the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not less than six nor more than ten days after the day first stated and notify the parties of the continuance.
 

(2)(i) If upon hearing the parties, or in case the tenant or person in possession shall neglect to appear after the summons and continuance the court shall find that the landlord had been in possession of the leased property, that the said tenancy is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do, the court shall thereupon give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the tenancy was made, and shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in possession so holding over.
 

(ii) Either party shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the circuit court for the county within ten days from the judgment.
 

(iii) If the tenant appeals and files with the District Court an affidavit that the appeal is not taken for delay, and also a good and sufficient bond with one or more securities conditioned that the tenant will prosecute the appeal with effect and well and truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession thereof until the determination of said appeal.
 

(iv) The appellate court shall, upon application of either party, set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than five nor more than 15 days after the application, and notice for the order for a hearing shall be served on the opposite party or that party’s counsel at least 5 days before the hearing.
 

(v) If the judgment of the District Court shall be in favor of the landlord, a warrant shall be issued by the appellate court to the sheriff, who shall proceed forthwith to execute the warrant.
 

(3)(i) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all cases of tenancies at the expiration of a stated term, tenancies from year to year, and tenancies of the month and by the week. In case of tenancies from year to year (including tobacco farm tenancies), notice in writing shall be given three months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy, except that in case of all other farm tenancies, the notice shall be given six months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy; and in monthly or weekly tenancies, a notice in writing of one month or one week, as the case may be, shall be so given.
 

(ii) This paragraph, so far as it relates to notices, does not apply in Baltimore City.
 

(iii) In Montgomery County, except in the case of single family dwellings, the notice by the landlord shall be two months in the case of residential tenancies with a term of at least month to month but less than from year to year.
 

(4) When the tenant shall give notice by parol to the landlord or to the landlord’s agent or representatives, at least one month before the expiration of the lease or tenancy in all cases except in cases of tenancies from year to year, and at least three months’ notice in all cases of tenancy from year to year (except in all cases of farm tenancy, the notice shall be six months), of the intention of the tenant to remove at the end of that year and to surrender possession of the property at that time, and the landlord, the landlord’s agent, or representative shall prove the notice from the tenant by competent testimony, it shall not be necessary for the landlord, the landlord’s agent or representative to provide a written notice to the tenant, but the proof of such notice from the tenant as aforesaid shall entitle the landlord to recover possession of the property hereunder. This paragraph shall not apply in Baltimore City.
 

(5) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall not operate as a waiver of any notice to quit, notice of intent to vacate or any judgment for possession unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing. Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then to any loss of rent caused by the holdover. Any payment which is accepted in excess of the foregoing shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant in the same manner as security deposits as defined under § 8-203 of this title but shall not be subject to the penalties of that section.
 
Transformation of holdover tenant to periodic tenant

(c) Unless stated otherwise in the written lease and initialed by the tenant, when a landlord consents to a holdover tenant remaining on the premises, the holdover tenant becomes a periodic week-to-week tenant if the tenant was a week-to-week tenant before the tenant’s holding over, and a periodic month-to-month tenant in all other cases.

§ 8-402.1. Proceedings upon breach of lease
Currentness

Repossession of premises

(a)(1)(i) Where an unexpired lease for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the expiration of the stated term if the tenant breaches the lease, the landlord may make complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the premises is located if:
 

1. The tenant breaches the lease;
 

2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the leased premises; or
 

B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants, the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that the tenant or person in possession is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the leased premises; and
 

3. The tenant or person in actual possession of the premises refuses to comply.
 

(ii) The court shall summons immediately the tenant or person in possession to appear before the court on a day stated in the summons to show cause, if any, why restitution of the possession of the leased premises should not be made to the landlord.
 

(2)(i) If, for any reason, the tenant or person in actual possession cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously on the property.
 

(ii) After notice is sent to the tenant or person in possession by first-class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
 

(3) If either of the parties fails to appear before the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than six nor more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
 
Judgment for restitution of possession of premises

(b)(1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in possession.
 

(2) Either party may appeal to the circuit court for the county, within ten days from entry of the judgment.

Upon application of either party, the court shall set a day for the hearing of the appeal not less than five nor more than 15 days after the application, and notice of the order for a hearing shall be served on the other party or that party’s counsel at least five days before the hearing. If the judgment of the District Court is in favor of the landlord, a warrant shall be issued by the court which hears the appeal to the sheriff, who shall execute the warrant.
 
Payments after notice

(c)(1) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall not operate as a waiver of any notice of breach of lease or any judgment for possession unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
 

(2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.

(ii) Commences a proceeding to obtain relief from the judgment.
 
Payment of costs and damages sustained by landlord
