Currentness


(a) This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.
 

(b) Underlying purposes and policies of this chapter are:
 

(1) to simplify, clarify, modernize, and revise the law governing the rental of dwelling units and the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants;
 

(2) to encourage landlords and tenants to maintain and improve the quality of housing; and
 

(3) to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this chapter among those states which enact it.
 

(c) This chapter shall be construed as applying only to the residential landlord and tenant relationship. The chapter does not create any duties in tort or causes of action in tort, nor does it deprive anyone of any causes of action in tort that may exist apart from this chapter.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

Paragraph (c) has been added to emphasize this Act affects certain rights and responsibilities of parties that arise out of the landlord-tenant relationship. Other duties between parties remain unchanged and are governed by law apart from this Act.
 
COMMENT

Existing landlord-tenant law in the United States, save as modified by statute or judicial interpretation, is a product of English common law developed within an agricultural society at a time when doctrines of promissory contract were unrecognized. Thus, the landlord-tenant relationship was viewed as conveyance of a lease-hold estate and the covenants of the parties generally independent. These doctrines are inappropriate to modern urban conditions and inexpressive of the vital interests of the parties and the public which the law must protect.
 

This Act recognizes the modern tendency to treat performance of certain obligations of the parties as interdependent.
 

Liberal construction of this Act and its application for promotion of its underlying purposes and policies will permit development by the courts in light of unforeseen and new circumstances and practices. However, proper construction of the Act requires that its interpretation and application be limited to its reason.

This section indicates the policy that no Act which bears evidence of carefully considered permanent regulative intention should lightly be regarded as impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation. This Act, carefully integrated and intended as a uniform codification of permanent character covering an entire “field” of law, is to be regarded as particularly resistant to implied repeal.

(b) Any right or obligation declared by this chapter is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

Subsection (a) the last sentence was added to make clear the duty to mitigate damages when a tenant vacates the premises does not require the landlord to rent the property ahead of already vacant units.
 
COMMENT

Subsection (a) is intended to negate unduly narrow or technical interpretation of remedial provisions and to make clear that damages must be minimized. The use of the words “aggrieved party” is intended to indicate that in appropriate circumstances rights and remedies may extend to third persons under this Act or supplementary principles of law (compare Article IV, Divisions I and II).
 

Under subsection (b) any right or obligation described in this Act is enforceable by court action, even though no remedy may be expressly provided, unless a particular provision specifies a different and limited effect. Whether tort action, specific performance or equitable relief is available is determined not by this section but by specific provisions and supplementary principles (see Section 1.103) [35-9A-103].

No resolution or ordinance relative to residential landlords, rental housing codes, or the rights and obligations governing residential landlord and tenant relationships shall be enacted or enforced by any county or municipality, and any such resolution or ordinance enacted both prior to or after January 1, 2007, is superseded by this chapter. Notwithstanding these provisions, a county or municipality may enact and enforce building codes, health codes, and other general laws that affect rental property provided that such codes equally affect similarly situated owner-occupied residential property.

ALABAMA COMMENT

See Section 35-9A-102(c) which states this Act affects only the landlord-tenant relationship and does not create any cause of action or deprive anyone of a cause of action in tort. To make this abundantly clear, “and is the exclusive remedy to” has been added to the Uniform Act.
 

This act preempts municipalities and counties from enacting residential landlord tenant codes. Further, any code existing on the effective date of the act will be superseded by this Act. This preemption is only to specific residential landlord tenant codes and does not encompass municipal and county resolutions or ordinances that apply to general housing laws which affect health and safety.

Unless created to avoid the application of this chapter, the following arrangements are not governed by this chapter:
 

(1) residence at an institution, public or private, if incidental to detention or the provision of medical, geriatric, educational, counseling, religious, or similar service;
 

(2) occupancy under a contract of sale of a dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part, if the occupant is the purchaser or a person who succeeds to the interest of the purchaser;
 

(3) occupancy by a member of a fraternal or social organization in the portion of a structure operated for the benefit of the organization;
 

(4) transient occupancy in a hotel, motel, or lodgings;
 

(5) occupancy by an employee of a landlord whose right to occupancy is conditional upon employment in and about the premises;
 

(6) occupancy by an owner of a condominium unit or a holder of a proprietary lease in a cooperative;
 

(7) occupancy under a rental agreement covering premises rented by the occupant primarily for agricultural purposes;
 

(8) continuation of occupancy by the seller or a member of the seller’s family for a period of not more than 36 months after the sale of a dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

In paragraph (7) the word “rented” has been substituted for the word “used” in the Uniform Act for clarity.
 

Paragraph (8) has been added to provide that a continued occupancy by the seller for a period of not more than 36 months after selling the dwelling is not governed under this act.
 
COMMENT

This Act regulates landlord-tenant relations in residential properties. It is not intended to apply where residence is incidental to another primary purpose such as residence in a prison, a hospital or nursing home, a dormitory owned and operated by a college or school, or residence by a landlord’s employee such as a custodian, janitor, guard or caretaker rendering service in or about the demised premises. This Act is intended to apply to government or public agencies acting as landlords (Section 1.301(8)) [35-9A-141(8)].
 

This Act does not apply to occupancy by a purchaser under a contract of sale. This Act applies to occupancy by the holder of an option to purchase, as distinguished from a contract of sale.
 

This Act applies to roomers and boarders but is not intended to apply to transient occupancy. In many jurisdictions transient hotel operations are subject to special taxes and regulations and, where available, determinations under such authority constitute appropriate criteria.
 

All of the exclusions enumerated apply only to genuine, bona fide arrangements not created to avoid the application of the Act and are subject to the test of good faith (see Section 1.302) [35-9A-142].
 

Subsection (3) A fraternal or social organization is deemed to also cover “athletic club”.

Subject to additional definitions contained in subsequent articles of this chapter which apply to specific articles or divisions thereof, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this chapter:
 

(1) “action” includes recoupment, counterclaim, set-off, suit in equity, and any other proceeding in which rights are determined, including an action for possession;
 

(2) “building and housing codes” include any law, ordinance, or governmental regulation concerning fitness for habitation, or the construction, maintenance, operation, occupancy, use, or appearance of any premises or dwelling unit;
 

(3) “day” means calendar day, notwithstanding Rule 6 of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure; however, in any case where the application of a time period in this chapter consisting of a specific number of days results in the last day of that time period falling on a weekend or an official holiday, then the last day of that time period shall be considered the next official business day when the court is open;
 

(4) “dwelling unit” means a structure or the part of a structure, including a manufactured home, that is rented as a home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons;
 

(5) “eviction” means a civil action filed as a remedy, where a tenant has lawfully taken possession of a premises and fails or refuses, after the termination of the possessory interest of the tenant, to deliver possession of the premises to anyone lawfully entitled or to his or her agent or attorney;
 

(6) “good faith” means honesty in fact in the conduct of the transaction concerned;
 

(7) “landlord” means the owner, lessor, or sublessor of the dwelling unit or the building of which it is a part, and it also means a manager of the premises;
 

(8) “organization” includes a corporation, government, governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, and any business entity;
 

(9) “owner” means one or more persons, jointly or severally, in whom is vested (i) all or part of the legal title to property or (ii) all or part of the beneficial ownership and a right to present use and enjoyment of the premises. The term includes a mortgagee only when in possession;
 

(10) “person” includes an individual, individuals, or organization;
 

(11) “premises” means a dwelling unit and the structure of which it is a part and facilities and appurtenances therein and grounds, areas, and facilities held out for the use of tenants generally or whose use is promised by the rental agreement to the tenant;
 

(12) “rent” means all payments to be made to or for the benefit of the landlord under the rental agreement;
 

(13) “rental agreement” means all agreements, written or oral, and valid rules and regulations adopted under Section 35-9A-302 embodying the terms and conditions concerning the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit and premises;
 

(14) “roomer” means a person occupying a dwelling unit that does not include a toilet, a refrigerator, stove, kitchen sink, and either a bath tub or a shower, all provided by the landlord, and where one or more of these facilities are used in common by occupants in the structure;
 

(15) “single family residence” means a structure maintained and used as a single dwelling unit. Notwithstanding that a dwelling unit shares one or more walls with another dwelling unit, it is a single family residence if it has direct access to a street or thoroughfare and shares neither heating facilities, hot water equipment, nor any other essential facility or service with any other dwelling unit; and
 

(16) “tenant” means a person entitled under a rental agreement to occupy a dwelling unit to the exclusion of others.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

Subsection (3) “Day” was defined to clarify that day means calendar day and not business day.
 

Subsection (7) “Landlord” deletes from the Uniform Act the words “who fails to disclose as required by Section 35-9A-202”.
 

Subsection (9) Alabama being a “title state”, the mortgagee holds legal title but the mortgagor typically remains in possession and will for this Act be considered the “owner” except when the mortgagee goes into possession.
 
COMMENT

Subsection (2) Typical of such “building and housing codes” are housing, building, sanitation, electrical, plumbing, fire prevention, safety and security ordinances and regulations. It is intended to include all such codes whether enacted or promulgated under federal, state or local authority.
 

Subsection (7) Accordingly, in the case of an active trust where all the duties and powers of management inure to the trustee and the rights of the beneficiary are limited to the receipt of income from the trust estate and the beneficiary has no right to the present use and enjoyment of the property, the trustee would be considered an owner but the beneficiary would not. In the case of property held in the name of a nominee or straw the beneficial owner would be considered an owner.
 

Subsection (9) Agricultural leases are excluded from operation of the Act (Section 1.202(7)). Inclusion of “grounds, areas and facilities held out for the use of tenants” does not alter the exclusion.
 

Subsection (11) “Rental agreement” will thus include the original agreement between landlord and tenant as well as any modification and all valid rules and regulations concerning use and occupancy as provided in Section 3.102.
 

Subsection (12) This Act provides lesser rights to a roomer as distinguished from the tenant of a dwelling unit. The definition requires certain facilities to be provided by the landlord. This requirement is not met by provision of the same by the tenant.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

The obligation of good faith is extended to all “agreements” and “duties” under the Act. This section in the Uniform Act only enumerates “duties”. Good faith as to “agreements” are specifically enumerated elsewhere in the Uniform Act. The Alabama Act places the obligation of good faith for both “agreements and duties” in one section and deletes it in other places.
 
COMMENT

Section 1.302 [35-9A-142] is adapted from Section 1-203 of the Uniform Commercial Code. As the commentators there said, “This section sets forth a basic principle running throughout this Act. The principle involved is that in commercial transactions good faith is required in the performance and enforcement of all agreements or duties.” The commentators there drew attention to particular applications of this general principle. The intention is that the rule be identical in landlord-tenant relationships and, similarly, particular applications of this general principle appear in specific provisions of this Act such as exclusions (Section 1.202) [35-9A-102], retaliatory eviction as well as complaints made to public authorities (Section 5.101) [35-9A-501], and obligation of the landlord to repair (Section 2.104) [35-9A-204].

Currentness


(a) If the court, as a matter of law, finds:
 

(1) a rental agreement or any provision thereof was unconscionable when made, the court may refuse to enforce the agreement, enforce the remainder of the agreement without the unconscionable provision, or limit the application of any unconscionable provision to avoid an unconscionable result; or
 

(2) a settlement in which a party waives or agrees to forego a claim or right under this chapter or under a rental agreement was unconscionable when made, the court may refuse to enforce the settlement, enforce the remainder of the settlement without the unconscionable provision, or limit the application of any unconscionable provision to avoid an unconscionable result.
 

(b) If unconscionability is put into issue by a party or by the court upon its own motion, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the rental agreement or settlement to aid the court in making the determination.

COMMENT

This Section, adapted from the Uniform Commercial Code and the Consumer Credit Code, is intended to make it possible for the courts to police explicitly against rental agreements, clauses, settlements, or waivers of claim or right which they find to be unconscionable. This section is intended to allow the courts to pass directly on the issue of unconscionability and to make a conclusion of law as to unconscionability. The basic test is whether, in light of the background and setting of the market, the conditions of the particular parties to the rental agreement, settlement or waiver of right or claim are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the agreement or settlement. Thus, the particular facts involved in each case are of utmost importance since unconscionability may exist in some situations but not in others. Either landlords or tenants may, in appropriate circumstances, avail themselves of this section.

(1) the person has actual knowledge of it;
 

(2) the person has received a notice or notification of it; or
 

(3) from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, the person has reason to know that it exists.
 

(b) A person “knows” or “has knowledge” of a fact if the person has actual knowledge of it.
 

(c) A person “notifies” or “gives” a notice or notification to another person by taking steps reasonably calculated to inform the other in ordinary course whether or not the other actually comes to know of it. A person presumatively “receives” a notice or notification when:
 

(1) it comes to the person’s attention;
 

(2) in the case of the landlord, it is delivered at the place of business of the landlord or mailed to any place designated by the landlord as the place for receipt of the communication; or
 

(3) in the case of the tenant, it is delivered in hand to the tenant or three days after mailing with adequate prepaid postage in the United States mail to the tenant’s last known place of residence.
 

(d) “Notice,” knowledge of a notice, or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the organization.
 

(e) Notice provided in this section does not apply to the notice required to terminate a tenancy or evict a tenant.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

The presumption of receipt in subsection (b) merely shifts the burden of proof of non-receipt to the party denying receipt of notice. Presumptive delivery to a landlord in subsection (b)(2) occurs when there is personal delivery by any means to the landlord’s place of business or mailing to an address designated by the landlord. Presumptive delivery to a tenant occurs when there is personal delivery to the tenant or three days after proper mailing to the tenant of notice by regular U.S. mail.
 

“Notice” was amended in subsection (c) from the Uniform Act to provide that knowledge is effective from the time it is brought to the attention of the “organization” rather than the “individual conducting the transaction”.
 

Pursuant to subsection (d), notice in this section applies to communications relating to the tenancy, but not to termination of the tenancy or eviction of a tenant.
 
COMMENT

This section is adapted from Section 7-1-201(25) of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 1.302 [35-9A-142] imposes the obligation of good faith and is, of course, applicable to this section.

In absence of an agreement for a definite term of lease, the tenant has a term of month-to-month without regard to the payment of rent weekly, monthly or otherwise, and a roomer [tenant] who pays rent for longer intervals than week-to-week has a month-to-month term. As to termination of such tenancies, see Section 35-9A-441.

COMMENT

The subsections above apply to transactions in which a written rental agreement has been signed and delivered by either landlord or tenant, the parties have agreed on terms, and the defect is solely the absence of a signature. Delivery thus means legal rather than physical delivery alone. Thus knowledge or notice of the signing of the rental agreement is required. These subsections do not apply to applications for leases or similar writings regarded by the parties as preliminary to written agreements.

(a) A rental agreement may not provide that the tenant:
 

(1) agrees to waive or forego rights or remedies established under Section 35-9A-204, 35-9A-401, or 35-9A-404, or requirements of security deposits established by this chapter or under the law of unlawful detainer;
 

(2) authorizes any person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of the rental agreement;
 

(3) agrees to pay the landlord’s attorney’s fees or cost of collection; or
 

(4) agrees to the exculpation or limitation of any liability of the landlord arising under law or to indemnify the landlord for that liability or the costs connected therewith.
 

(b) A provision prohibited by subsection (a) included in a rental agreement is unenforceable. If a landlord seeks to enforce a provision in a rental agreement containing provisions known by the landlord to be prohibited, the tenant may recover in addition to actual damages an amount up to one month’s periodic rent and reasonable attorney’s fees.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

(a)(1) The prohibition of waiver applies to rights and remedies relating to Section 35-9A-204, “Landlord Maintaining the Premises”; 35-9A-401, “Noncompliance by the Landlord in General”; and 35-9A-404, the “Wrongful Failure to Make Available Heat, Water, Hot Water or Essential Services, and Security Deposits”.
 

(a)(3) The addition of a prohibition of “cost of collection” is to prohibit a third party from assessing a collection cost.
 

(b) This section is not effective until January 1, 2008 to enable the landlord sufficient time to revise the rental agreements before subjecting the landlord to the penalties prescribed in section (b).
 
COMMENT

Rental agreements are often executed on forms provided by landlords, and some contain adhesion clauses the use of which is prohibited by this section. Section 2.415 of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code provides “a buyer or lessee may not authorize any person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of a consumer credit sale or consumer lease.” The official comment to this section states “This section reflects the view of the great majority of states in prohibiting authorization to confess judgment.” Similarly, clauses attempting to exculpate the landlord from tort liability for his own wrong have been declared illegal by statutes in some states (compare Mass.G.L. Chapter 186, Sec. 15; New York Real Property Law Section 234; and Ill.Ann.Stat., Chapter 80, Section 15a (Smith-Hurd) 1966). Such provisions, even though unenforceable at law may nevertheless prejudice and injure the rights and interests of the uninformed tenant who may, for example, surrender or waive rights in settlement of an enforceable claim against the landlord for damages arising from the landlord’s negligence.
 

Attorney’s fees under the Act may be asserted against either the landlord or tenant as enumerated in the Act (see, for example, Sections 1.403(b) [35-9A-163]; 4.101(b) [35-9A-401(b)]; 4.105(a) [35-9A-405(a)]). The right to recover attorney’s fees against the tenant, however, must arise under the statute, not by contract of the parties.

ALABAMA COMMENT

(a) Pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the landlord may require the deposit of cash of not more than one month’s rent as security but may not hold property as security. The landlord may require more than one month’s rent as a pet deposit or increased liability risks for damages to the property. When a tenant makes temporary changes to the property such as a ramp or handrails for the handicapped, the landlord may require an additional deposit to assure the premises will be returned to their original condition at the end of the tenancy. Regulations at 24 C.F.R. § 100.203 under the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., impose additional limitations and requirements with respect to security deposits for modifications necessary for handicapped tenants.
 

The Uniform Act section (c) has been deleted and a new section (c), (d), (e), and (f) added, with the Uniform Act sections (d) and (e) renumbered as new sections (g) and (h).
 

Subsection (b) requires the landlord to refund the deposit within 35 days of the tenant delivering possession and does not require the tenant to demand deposit.
 

Subsection (c) is added to the Uniform Act provision that if the entire deposit is not returned there must be an itemized list of the amounts withheld.
 

Subsection (d) is new and requires the tenant to provide a forwarding address. Any deposit shall be mailed to the forwarding address, or if none to the tenant’s last known address, or if none, to the tenant at the address of the property. If the letter is returned undelivered with the deposit check and the tenant does not make a claim for the check within 180 days after its return the deposit is forfeited and may be kept by the landlord.
 

Subsection (e) landlord may send the deposit as provided in paragraph (d) by first class mail.
 

Subsection (f) requires a landlord who fails to timely refund or account for a security deposit to pay the tenant double the amount that would have been refunded if the funds had been returned promptly.
 
COMMENT

Widely varying legislation has been enacted affecting security deposits:
 

California -- Chapter 1317, Acts of 1970, West.Cal.Civ.Code, Sec. 1951.
 

Colorado -- H.B.No.1230, Acts of 1971, Colo.Rev.Stat.Ann., Ch. 58 (Forcible Entry and Detainer), Sec. 1-26-28.
 

Delaware -- H.B. 433, Acts of 1971, Del.Code Ann. (Landlord-Tenant), Title 25, Ch. 51, Sec. 5912.
 

Florida -- Chapter 70-360, Acts of 1970, Fla.Stat.Ann.Civil Practice and Procedure, Ch. 83 (Landlord and Tenant), Sec. 83.261.
 

Illinois -- P.A. 77-705, Sec. 3, Acts of 1971, Ill.Stat.Ann., Ch. 74 (Interest), Sec. 91-93.
 

Maryland -- Chapter 633, Sec. 1 of Acts of 1969, as amended by Chapter 291 of Acts of 971, Md.Ann.Code, Art. 53 (Landlord and Tenant), Sec. 41-43.
 

Massachusetts -- Chapter 244, Sec. 1 of Acts of 1969, as amended by Chapter 666, Sec. 1 of Acts of 1970, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., Ch. 186 (Title to Real Property), Sec. 15B.
 

Minnesota -- Chapter 784 of Acts of 1971, Minn.Stat., Ch. 504 (Landlord and Tenant), Sec. 504.19.
 

New Jersey -- S.B. 904, Acts of 1970, N.J.Rev.Stat., Sec. 2A:46-8.
 

New York -- Chapter 680, Sec. 70 of Acts of 1967, as amended, N.Y.Gen.Obligation Laws, Sec. 7-103 and 7-105.
 

Pennsylvania -- Pa.Stat.Ann., Title 68 (Real and Personal Property), Sec. 250.512.
 

These statutes generally require a landlord to return security deposits to tenants within a specified time period, account for his claim to any part of the security deposit and provide for penalty in the event landlord fails to comply.
 

This section does not limit the amount of prepaid rent, as distinguished from security.
 

Subsection (h) of this section resolves a split of authority among the states. See 1 A.L.P. Section 3.73, nn. 9-15. Note that under Section 2.105(a) of the Act the original landlord is bound.

(a) The word “business” has been added before address to clarify which address of the manager or owner of the premises must be given to the tenant.
 
COMMENT

This section requires disclosure to the tenant of names and addresses of persons who (a) have power to negotiate, make repairs, etc., in the operation of the premises; (b) are empowered to receive service of notice and process which binds all of the owners. In the absence of such disclosure the person collecting the rent shall be deemed to have the authority to accept notices and service and to provide for the necessary maintenance and repairs.
 

The purpose of this section is to enable the tenant to proceed with the appropriate legal proceeding, to know to whom complaints must be addressed and, failing satisfaction, against whom the appropriate legal proceedings may be instituted. Rights under this section are additional to those provided in Section 1.203 [35-9A-123].

Thus, the landlord may proceed directly against a squatter. The tenant may also, pursuant to Section 4.102(a) [35-9A-402(a)], proceed with an action for possession. Where appropriate such actions may be in summary proceedings. It is thus possible that both landlord and tenant may have the right of action against third parties wrongfully in possession of the premises.

(3) keep all common areas of the premises in a clean and safe condition;

(5) provide and maintain appropriate receptacles and conveniences for the removal of garbage, rubbish, and other waste incidental to the occupancy of the dwelling unit and arrange for their removal; and
 

(6) supply running water and reasonable amounts of hot water at all times and reasonable heat except where the building that includes the dwelling unit is not required by law to be equipped for that purpose, or the dwelling unit is so constructed that heat or hot water is generated by an installation within the exclusive control of the tenant and supplied by a direct public utility connection.

ALABAMA COMMENT

Subsection (a)(1) requires compliance with various applicable city, county, and state building and housing codes. The generally accepted code is the “Standard Housing Code” by the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc.
 

The enforcement of Subsection (a)(3) may also include applicable duties outside this code which are unaffected by this Act.
 

The “good faith” provision in subparagraph (c) was deleted since all agreements must be in good faith as provided in Section 35-9A-142.
 

Subparagraph (f) has been added to make clear that tenants cannot benefit from their own willful or negligent act.
 
COMMENT

Subsections (a) and (b) Vital interests of the parties and public under modern urban conditions require the proper maintenance and operation of housing. It is thus necessary that minimum duties of landlords and tenants be set forth. Generally duties of repair and maintenance of the dwelling unit and the premises are imposed upon the landlord by this section. Major repairs, even access, to essential systems outside the dwelling unit are beyond the capacity of the tenant. Conversely, duties of cleanliness and proper use within the dwelling unit are appropriately fixed upon the tenant (see Sections 3.101 [35-9A-301] and 3.102 [35-9A-302]).
 

Entire section This section follows the warranty of habitability doctrine recognized in the jurisdictions of
 

California -- Hinson v. Delis, 26 C.A.3d 62.
 

Washington, D.C. -- Javins v. First National Realty, (U.S.C.A.D.C.1970) 428 F.2d 1071.
 

Wisconsin -- Pines v. Perssion, (1961) 111 N.W.2d 409.
 

New Jersey -- Resta Realty Corp. v. Cooper, (1969) 53 N.J. 444.
 

Illinois -- Jack Springs Inc. v. Little, (1972) 280 N.E.2d 208.
 

Hawaii -- Lemler v. Breedin, (1969) 462 P.2d 470.
 

Michigan -- Rome v. Walker, (1972) 196 N.W.2d 850.
 

New Hampshire -- Kline v. Burns, (1971) 276 A.2d 248.
 

Colorado -- Guesenbury v. Patrick, (March 1972) C.C.H.Pov.L.Rptr. Sec. 15,803.
 

Georgia -- Gevens v. Gray, (April 1972) C.C.H.Pov.L.Rptr. Sec. 15,412.
 

Standards of habitability dealt with in this section are a matter of public police power rather than the contract of the parties or special landlord-tenant legislation. This section establishes minimum duties of landlords consistent with public standards. Generally duties of repair and maintenance of the dwelling unit and the premises are imposed upon the landlord by this section. Major repairs, even access, to essential systems, outside the dwelling unit are beyond the capacity of the tenant. Conversely, duties of cleanliness and proper use within the dwelling unit are appropriately fixed upon the tenant (see Sections 3.101 and 3.102).
 

Except as specifically provided, these obligations may not be waived (Section 1.403 [35-9A-163]).

ALABAMA COMMENT

When the original landlord is released of liability, the bona fide purchaser from the landlord assumes the liability of the original landlord.
 
COMMENT

This section relieves a landlord, unless otherwise agreed, from liability under the rental agreement and this Act as to events occurring after a good faith sale and conveyance to a bona fide purchaser and after written notice to the tenant of the conveyance except as to security recoverable under Section 2.101 and all prepaid rent. As between the original landlord and tenant, it is intended that the loss for failure to account for security and prepaid rent if recoverable should fall upon the landlord who, in contrast to the tenant, can take steps to protect the integrity of the security and prepaid rent account at the time of sale. The landlord for the time being is liable for compliance with the rental agreement and this Act. See definition of “landlord” in Section 1.301(5) [35-9A-141(6)]. See also Sections 1.404 [35-9A-164] and 2.105(a) [35-9A-205(a)].

Ala.Code 1975 § 35-9A-302
§ 35-9A-302. Rules and regulations.
Currentness


(a) “Rules” or “regulations” pertaining to a residential lease are defined as policies of the landlord affecting the maintenance, operation, or governance of the common areas of the premises, or concerning the general conduct of tenants in their use and enjoyment of the leased premises.
 

(b) A landlord, from time to time, may adopt a rule or regulation. It is enforceable against the tenant only if:
 

(1) its purpose is to promote the convenience, safety, or welfare of the tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord’s property from abusive use, or make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for the tenants generally;
 

(2) it is reasonably related to the purpose of which it is adopted;
 

(3) it applies to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;
 

(4) it is sufficiently explicit in its prohibition, direction, or limitation of the tenant’s conduct to fairly inform the tenant of what the tenant must or must not do to comply;
 

(5) it is not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord; and
 

(6) the tenant has notice of it at the time the tenant enters into the rental agreement, or when it is adopted.
 

(c) If a rule or regulation is adopted after the tenant enters into the rental agreement that works a substantial modification of the tenant’s use of the leased premises, it is not valid unless the tenant consents to it in writing. In the case of any variance between the lease and a rule or regulation, the lease prevails.

Subsection (a) has been added to the Uniform Act to define the “rules” or “regulations”.
 

Subsection (b) deleted from the Uniform Act the words “however described concerning the tenant’s use and occupancy of the premises” since “rules and regulations” have been defined.
 

Subsection (c) the tenant’s “bargain” in the Uniform Act was changed to “tenant’s use of the leased premises”. Further, the last sentence has been added to this subsection to clarify that least prevails over a conflicting regulation.
 
COMMENT

Under Section 1.301(11) [35-9A-141(12)] the rental agreement includes valid rules and regulations.

(a) A tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workmen, or contractors.
 

(b) A landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant only in the following circumstances:
 

(1) In case of emergency.
 

(2) Pursuant to court order.
 

(3) As permitted by Sections 35-9A-422 and 35-9A-423(b).

(5) When the landlord has reasonable cause to believe the tenant has abandoned or surrendered the premises.
 

(c) A landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. Except as provided in this section or unless it is impracticable to do so, the landlord may show the premises at any reasonable time by giving the tenant at least two days’ notice of the landlord’s intent to enter and may enter only at reasonable times. Posting of a note on the primary door of entry to the residence of the tenant stating the intended time and purpose of the entry shall be a permitted method of notice for the purpose of the landlord’s right of access to the premises.
 

(d) If a landlord provides separate from the lease in a general notice or an advance schedule in excess of two days for repairs, maintenance, pest control, or for service relating to health or safety, whether such notice is for a specific time or within a designated time period, then no additional day’s notice is required to access the premises. A tenant may consent to provide a landlord with access to the premises with less than two days’ notice.
 

(e) If a tenant requests repairs or maintenance or improvements to a dwelling unit, the tenant shall be deemed to have granted consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit and make the repairs, maintenance, or improvements as requested by the tenant.

(1) if the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the landlord adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate by reason of the breach.
 

(2) the tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant’s family, a licensee, or other person on the premises with the tenant’s consent.

ALABAMA COMMENT

Subsection (a)(2) of the Uniform Act has been omitted.
 

Subsection (b) of the Uniform Act the landlord’s noncompliance has been changed from “willful” to “in bad faith”.
 
COMMENT

Claims arising under this section if disputed in good faith may be settled by agreement (see Section 1.106) [35-9A-106]. However, a prior settlement will not prevent a termination under Section 4.101(a)(2)(omitted).
 

The availability of injunctive relief is determined by usual principles of equity. See Section 1.103 [35-9A-103].
 

Remedies available to the tenant pursuant to Section 4.101 [35-9A-461] are not exclusive (see Section 1.103 [35-9A-103]). A duty to mitigate damages exists under Section 1.105 [35-9A-105]. As to rights of third parties, see comment under Section 1.105 [35-9A-105].

ALABAMA COMMENT

Subsection (a) is added to the Uniform Act to make clear the landlord is not responsible for the payment of utility services unless agreed in the lease.
 

In subsection (b) (formerly (a) of the Uniform Act) the word “supply” has been changed to “make available”. No substantive change is intended.
 

Former subsection (a)(3) concerning procuring substitute housing was omitted from the Uniform Act. Subsection (b) concerning payment for substitute housing of the Uniform Act was also omitted.
 

Section 35-9A-404(b)(1) does not specifically address collective action by tenants; the availability of such collective action shall be determined under applicable law.
 

The obligation of good faith in 35-9A-142 applies to this section as it does throughout the Act.

COMMENT

The remedies under Sections 4.107 [35-9A-407] and 5.101(b) [35-9A-501] are applicable where the landlord affirmatively acts to interrupt or diminish services, etc., and those remedies are in addition to the remedies provided in Sections 4.101 [35-9A-401], 4.103 [35-9A-403] and 4.104 [35-9A-404].
 

Section 4.104(a)(1) [35-9A-404(b)(1)] permits collective action by tenants to secure essential services.
 

Section 1.302 [35-9A-302] imposes the obligation of good faith and is, of course, applicable to this section.

The court shall determine the amount due to each party. The party to whom a net amount is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into court, and the balance by the other party. If no rent remains due after application of this section, judgment shall be entered for the tenant in the action for possession. If the defense or counterclaim by the tenant is without merit and is not raised in good faith, the landlord may recover reasonable attorney’s fees.
 

(b) In an action for rent when the tenant is not in possession, the tenant may counterclaim as provided in subsection (a) but is not required to pay any rent into court.

COMMENT

Article II defines the obligations of the landlord which the tenant may enforce against him (Section 1.105 [35-9A-105]). While Lindsey v. Normet (405 U.S. 56) holds no principle of constitutional law requires the admission of the habitability defense in a summary proceeding maintained by the landlord against the tenant, Section 4.105 [35-9A-405] is consistent with modern procedure reform in permitting the tenant to file a counterclaim or other appropriate pleading in the summary proceeding to the end that all issues between the parties may be disposed of in one proceeding. It is anticipated that upon filing of the counterclaim the court will enter the order deemed appropriate by him concerning the payment of rent in order to protect the interests of the parties. See cases in comment to Section 2.104 (e) [35-9A-204(e)].

Legislation has been adopted in various states providing that if the premises are so destroyed or injured as to be untenantable or unfit for occupancy the tenant may quit and surrender possession of the premises:
 

Arizona Rev.Stat., Sec. 33-343 (1956)
 

Connecticut Gen.Stat.Ann., Sec. 47-24 (1960)
 

Michigan Stat.Ann., Sec. 26.1121 (1953)
 

Minnesota Stat.Ann., Sec. 504.05 (1947)
 

Mississippi Code Ann., Sec. 898 (1957)
 

Wisconsin Stat.Ann., 234.17 (1957)
 

West Virginia in 1931 adopted Section 37-6-28 providing for “...a reasonable reduction of the rent for such time as may elapse until there be placed again upon the premises buildings, or other structures, of as much value to be tenant for his purposes as those destroyed....”

§ 35-9A-421. Noncompliance with rental agreement; failure to pay rent.
Effective: June 1, 2018
Currentness


(a) Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement, an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact in a rental agreement or application, or a noncompliance with Section 35-9A-301 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may deliver a written notice to terminate the lease to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than seven business days after receipt of the notice. An intentional misrepresentation of a material fact in a rental agreement or application may not be remedied or cured. If the breach is not remedied within the seven business days after receipt of the notice to terminate the lease, the rental agreement shall terminate on the date provided in the notice to terminate the lease unless the tenant adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, in which case the rental agreement shall not terminate.
 

(b) If rent is unpaid when due, the landlord may deliver a written notice to terminate the lease to the tenant specifying the amount of rent and any late fees owed to remedy the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than seven business days after receipt of the notice. If the breach is not remedied within the seven business days, the rental agreement shall terminate. If a noncompliance of rental agreement occurs under both subsection (a) and this subsection, the seven-day notice period to terminate the lease for nonpayment of rent in this subsection shall govern.
 

(c) Except as provided in this chapter, a landlord may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney fees and obtain injunctive relief for noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or Section 35-9A-301.
 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 35-9A-141, no breach of any of the terms or obligations of the lease may be cured by a tenant more than two times in any 12-month period except by the express written consent of the landlord. The following acts or omissions by a tenant or occupant shall constitute a noncurable default of the rental agreement, and in such cases the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon a seven-day notice. The tenant shall have no right to remedy such a default unless the landlord consents. Such acts and omissions include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

(1) Manufacture, cultivation, importation, transportation, possession, furnishing, administering, or use of illegal drugs in the dwelling unit or in the common areas.
 

(2) Illegal use, manufacture, importation, possession, furnishing, or discharging of a firearm or firearm ammunition on the premises of the rental property, except for the use or discharge of a firearm or firearm ammunition in cases of self-defense, defense of a third party, or as permissible in Section 13A-3-23.
 

(3) Criminal assault of a tenant or guest on the premises of the rental property, except in cases of self-defense, defense of a third party, or as permissible in Section 13A-3-23.
 

(4) Any breach involving substantially the same acts or omissions as a breach for which a notice to terminate has previously been provided for by the landlord and cured by the tenant, if the second breach occurs within six months of the first breach.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

Section (a) has been modified. A material breach in a term of the lease other than nonpayment of rent, notice to the tenant the lease will be terminated in 14 days unless the breach is remedied.
 

Subsection (b) shortens the notice period to terminate the lease for nonpayment of rent from 14 days to 7 days. The 7 days is after receipt of written notice to terminate. Where there is both a violation of the term of the lease and the rent is unpaid, the 7-day notice predominates.
 

An action for injunctive relief must be brought in circuit court. Injunctive relief is not available in district court.
 

The Uniform Act provides for where there has been a similar prior noncompliance within a 6 month period the landlord may terminate the lease. This provision was removed.
 
COMMENT

Claims arising under this section if disputed in good faith may be settled by agreement (see Section 1.106 [35-9A-106]). However, a prior settlement will not prevent a termination under the last sentence of Section 4.201(a) [35-9A-421].
 

The availability of injunctive relief is determined by the usual principles of equity. See Section 1.103 [35-9A-103].
 

Remedies available to the landlord pursuant to Section 4.201 [35-9A-421] are not exclusive (see Section 1.103 [35-9A-103]). A duty to mitigate exists under Section 1.105. As to rights of third parties, see comment under Section 1.105 [35-9A-105].

Currentness


(a) If a rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of 14 days pursuant to Section 35-9A-304 and the tenant willfully fails to do so, the landlord may recover actual damages from the tenant.
 

(b) During any absence of a tenant in excess of 14 days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary.
 

(c) If a tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it at a fair rental. But such duty shall not take priority over the landlord’s right to first rent other vacant units. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, it terminates as of the date of the new tenancy. If the tenancy is from month-to-month or week-to-week, the term of the rental agreement for this purpose is deemed to be a month or a week, as the case may be.
 

(d) If a tenant leaves property in the unit more than 14 days after termination pursuant to this chapter, the landlord has no duty to store or protect the tenant’s property in the unit and may dispose of it without obligation.
 

(e) In addition to any other means by which a landlord determines that a property has been abandoned by the tenant, a property shall be considered abandoned if the electric service to the property has been terminated for seven consecutive days.

§ 35-9A-461. Landlord’s action for eviction, rent, monetary damages, or other relief.
Currentness


(a) A landlord’s action for eviction, rent, monetary damages, or other relief relating to a tenancy subject to this chapter shall be governed by the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure and the Alabama Rules of Appellate Procedure except as modified by this chapter.
 

(b) District courts and circuit courts, according to their respective established jurisdictions, shall have jurisdiction over eviction actions, and venue shall lie in the county in which the leased property is located. Eviction actions shall be entitled to precedence in scheduling over all other civil cases.
 

(c) Service of process shall be made in accordance with the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure. However, if a sheriff, constable, or process server is unable to serve the defendant personally, service may be had by delivering the notice to any person who is sui juris residing on the premises, or if after reasonable effort no person is found residing on the premises, by posting a copy of the notice on the door of the premises, and on the same day of posting or by the close of the next business day, the sheriff, the constable, the person filing the complaint, or anyone on behalf of the person, shall mail notice of the filing of the unlawful detainer action by enclosing, directing, stamping, and mailing by first class a copy of the notice to the defendant at the mailing address of the premises and if there is no mailing address for the premises to the last known address, if any, of the defendant and making an entry of this action on the return filed in the case. Service of the notice by posting shall be complete as of the date of mailing the notice.
 

(d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of Section 12-12-70, any party may appeal from an eviction judgment entered by a district court to the circuit court at any time within seven days after the entry thereof. The filing of a timely post-judgment motion pursuant to the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure shall suspend the running of the time for filing a notice of appeal. In cases where post-judgment motions are filed, the full time fixed for filing a notice of appeal shall be computed from the date of the entry in the civil docket of an order granting or denying such motion, or the date of the denial of such motion by operation of law pursuant to Rule 59.1 of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon filing of an appeal by either party, the clerk of the court shall schedule the action for trial as a preferred case, and it shall be set for trial within 60 days from the date of the filing of the appeal. In eviction actions, an appeal by a tenant to circuit court or to an appellate court does not prevent the issuance of a writ of restitution or possession unless the tenant pays to the clerk of the circuit court all rents properly payable under the terms of the lease since the date of the filing of the action, and continues to pay all rent that becomes due and properly payable under the terms of the lease as they become due, during the pendency of the appeal. In the event of dispute, the amounts properly payable shall be ascertained by the court.
 

(1) If the tenant should fail to make any payments determined to be properly payable as they become due under this subsection, upon motion, the court shall issue a writ of restitution or possession and the landlord shall be placed in full possession of the premises.
 

(2) Upon disposition of the appeal, the court shall direct the clerk as to the disposition of the funds paid to the clerk pursuant to this subsection.
 

(e) If an eviction judgment enters in favor of a landlord, a writ of possession shall issue upon application by the landlord. Notwithstanding Rule 62 of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure, the automatic stay on the issuance of the writ of possession or restitution shall be for a period of seven days. If a tenant without just cause re-enters the premises, the tenant can be held in contempt and successive writs may issue as are necessary to effectuate the eviction judgment.
 

(f) In the event that the landlord is placed in possession under a writ of restitution or possession, and on appeal the judgment is reversed and one entered for the tenant or the proceeding on appeal is quashed or dismissed, the circuit court may award a writ of restitution or possession to restore the tenant to possession as against the landlord, but not as against a third party. The issuance of the writ rests in the discretion of the appellate court, and the circuit court, in all cases, may direct writs of restitution or possession to be issued by the trial court when, in the judgment of the circuit court, such writ is proper or necessary.

(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a landlord may bring an action for possession if:
 

(1) the violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant, a member of the tenant’s family, or other person on the premises with the tenant’s consent;
 

(2) the tenant is in default in rent;
 

(3) compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit; or
 

(4) other material violations of the lease.
 

(d) The maintenance of an action under subsection (c) does not release the landlord from liability under subsection (b) of Section 35-9A-401.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

Subsection (b) is amended from the Uniform Act to omit the presumption that an action by or against the tenant within 6 months before the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord’s conduct was in retaliation.
 

Subsection (c)(4) has been added to the Uniform Act.
 
COMMENT

State and federal courts in California (Aweeka v. Bonds, 20 Cal.App.3d 281, 97 Cal.Rptr. 650 [1971]; Schweiger v. Bonds, 3 Cal.App.2d 507, 90 Cal.Rptr. 729 [1970]), Florida (Bowles v. Blue Lake Development Corp., [S.Florida, 1971], C.C.H.Pov.L.Rptr. Sec. 12,920), Massachusetts (McQueen v. Druker, 317 F.Supp. 1122 [D.Mass.1970]), New Jersey (Alexander Hamilton Savings and Loan Assn. v. Whalen, 107 N.J.Super. 89, 257 A.2d 7 [1969]; Engler v. Capital Management Corp., 112 N.J.Super. 445, 271 A.2d 615 [1970]; E. E. Newman Inc. v. Hallock, 116 N.J.Super. 220, 281 A.2d 544 [1971]; Silberg v. Lipscomb, 117 N.J.Super. 491, 285 A.2d 86 [1971]), New York (Hosey v. Club Van Courtlandt, 299 F.Supp. 501 [S.D.N.Y.1969]), Ohio (T.R.O. granted, Case No. 8375 [S.D.Ohio]), Wisconsin (Dickhut v. Norton, 45 Wis.2d 309, 173 N.W.2d 297 [1970]) and the District of Columbia (Edwards v. Habib, 397 F.2d 687 [D.C.Cir.1968]) have upheld the defense of retaliatory eviction.
 

A number of states by statute have recognized the defense: Cal.C.C. Sec. 1942.5; Conn.Gen.St.Ann., Sec. 42-540a [Supp.1969]; Del.Ch. 25 Sec. 5917 [Supp.1971]; Ha.Ch. 666 Sec. 43 [Supp.1971]; Ill.Rev.St.Ch. 80, Sec. 71 [Supp.1971]; Me.Rev.St. Tit. 14 Sec. 6001, 6002; Md.Laws Ch. 687 Sec. 9-10 [Supp.1971]; Mass.Comp.Laws Ann., Ch. 186 Sec. 18 [Supp.1970]; Mich.Comp.Laws Ann., Ch. 600, Sec. 5646 [Am’d P.S.1969]; Minn.Stat.Ch. 240 Sec. 566.03 [Supp.1971]; N.J.Stat.Ann. 2A Sec. 42-10.10; N.Y. [McKinney’s] Unconsolidated Laws, Tit. 23 Sec. 8590, 8609 [Supp.1971]; Pa.St.Ann.Ch. 35, Sec. 1700-1 [Supp.1971]; R.I. Gen.Laws Ann. Sec. 34-20-10 [1968]. The legislatures of Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Michigan, and Rhode Island also protect tenants from eviction if they have organized or become a member of a tenants’ union or similar organization.
 

The question as to whether the landlord is engaging in retaliatory conduct as prohibited by the statute is a question of fact to be determined by the court.

Editors’ Notes
ALABAMA COMMENT

The section requiring that leases not include prohibited provisions becomes effective January 1, 2008 to allow the landlords an additional year to revise their leases before the penalty for noncompliance is effective.
 
COMMENT

This section, drawn from Section 10-101 of the Uniform Commercial Code, is also drawn with the idea of an effective date considerably in advance so there may be ample time for all of those who may be affected by the provisions of the Act to become familiar with it. It is intended that the Act apply to all leases, renewals, and other events occurring after its effective date.
