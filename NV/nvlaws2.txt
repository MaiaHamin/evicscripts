Effective: October 1, 2009
Currentness


1. The landlord may not demand or receive security or a surety bond, or a combination thereof, including the last month’s rent, whose total amount or value exceeds 3 months’ periodic rent.
 

2. In lieu of paying all or part of the security required by the landlord, a tenant may, if the landlord consents, purchase a surety bond to secure the tenant’s obligation to the landlord under the rental agreement to:
 

(a) Remedy any default of the tenant in the payment of rent.
 

(b) Repair damages to the premises other than normal wear and tear.
 

(c) Clean the dwelling unit.
 

3. The landlord:
 

(a) Is not required to accept a surety bond purchased by the tenant in lieu of paying all or part of the security; and
 

(b) May not require a tenant to purchase a security bond in lieu of paying all or part of the security.
 

4. Upon termination of the tenancy by either party for any reason, the landlord may claim of the security or surety bond, or a combination thereof, only such amounts as are reasonably necessary to remedy any default of the tenant in the payment of rent, to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant other than normal wear and to pay the reasonable costs of cleaning the premises. The landlord shall provide the tenant with an itemized written accounting of the disposition of the security or surety bond, or a combination thereof, and return any remaining portion of the security to the tenant no later than 30 days after the termination of the tenancy by handing it to the tenant personally at the place where the rent is paid, or by mailing it to the tenant at the tenant’s present address or, if that address is unknown, at the tenant’s last known address.
 

5. If a tenant disputes an item contained in an itemized written accounting received from a landlord pursuant to subsection 4, the tenant may send a written response disputing the item to the surety. If the tenant sends the written response within 30 days after receiving the itemized written accounting, the surety shall not report the claim of the landlord to a credit reporting agency unless the surety obtains a judgment against the tenant.
 

6. If the landlord fails or refuses to return the remainder of a security deposit within 30 days after the end of a tenancy, the landlord is liable to the tenant for damages:
 

(a) In an amount equal to the entire deposit; and
 

(b) For a sum to be fixed by the court of not more than the amount of the entire deposit.
 

7. In determining the sum, if any, to be awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 6, the court shall consider:
 

(a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
 

(b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant; and
 

(c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s conduct.
 

8. Except for an agreement which provides for a nonrefundable charge for cleaning, in a reasonable amount, no rental agreement may contain any provision characterizing any security under this section as nonrefundable or any provision waiving or modifying a tenant’s rights under this section. Any such provision is void as contrary to public policy.
 

9. The claim of a tenant to security to which the tenant is entitled under this chapter takes precedence over the claim of any creditor of the landlord.

(2) Fails to remedy or attempt in good faith to remedy the breach within the time prescribed in the written notice of that condition from the governmental agency.
 

4. The rights of the tenant under paragraph (c) of subsection 1 do not arise unless the tenant is current in the payment of rent at the time of giving written notice pursuant to subsection 1.

Currentness


1. In an action for possession based upon nonpayment of rent or in an action for rent where the tenant is in possession, the tenant may defend and counterclaim for any amount which the tenant may recover under the rental agreement, this chapter, or other applicable law. If it appears that there is money which may be due to the landlord by the tenant after the day of the hearing or if a judgment is delayed for any reason, the court shall require a tenant who remains in possession of the premises to deposit with the court a just and reasonable amount to satisfy the obligation, but not more than 1 day’s rent for each day until the new hearing date. The court shall order the tenant to pay the landlord any rent which is not in dispute and shall determine the amount due to each party. Upon the application of either party, the court, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may for good cause release to either party all or any portion of the rent paid into court by the tenant. The court shall award the prevailing party the amount owed and shall give judgment for any other amount which is due.
 

2. In any action for rent where the tenant is not in possession, the tenant may counterclaim as provided in subsection 1 but is not required to pay any rent into court.
 

3. When the court renders a decision on the landlord’s claim for possession, it shall distribute any rent paid into court under subsection 1 upon a determination of the amount due to each party.
 

4. If a tenant fails to deposit with the court within 24 hours after the original hearing the entire amount required pursuant to subsection 1, the tenant relinquishes the right to a hearing and the court shall at that time grant a judgment for eviction without further hearing.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the landlord may not, in retaliation, terminate a tenancy, refuse to renew a tenancy, increase rent or decrease essential items or services required by the rental agreement or this chapter, or bring or threaten to bring an action for possession if:

3. A landlord who acts under the circumstances described in subsection 1 does not violate that subsection if:
 

(a) The violation of the applicable building, housing or health code of which the tenant complained was caused primarily by the lack of reasonable care by the tenant, a member of his or her household or other person on the premises with his or her consent;
 

(b) The tenancy is terminated with cause;
 

(c) A citation has been issued and compliance with the applicable building, housing or health code requires alteration, remodeling or demolition and cannot be accomplished unless the tenant’s dwelling unit is vacant; or
