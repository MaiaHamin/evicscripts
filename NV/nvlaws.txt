Currentness


1. Unless exempted by subsection 3, every landlord of real property leased or otherwise rented to a tenant, including every landlord of a mobile home park, shall deliver to the tenant in July of each year, and whenever the periodic rent changes, a statement which shows separately for each periodic payment of rent:
 

(a) The amount which represents property taxes paid by the landlord; and
 

(b) The remainder of that payment.
 

2. If the property rented is one of several upon which the landlord pays taxes together, the amount which represents property taxes must be calculated by:
 

(a) Apportioning the total property tax paid for the year upon the entire property among the individual properties rented according to their respective areas.
 

(b) Reducing the amount so apportioned to each particular property for the year by the appropriate fraction to correspond to the period for which rent on it is paid.
 

3. This section does not apply to:
 

(a) Any property covered by a written agreement which requires the tenant to pay the property tax or otherwise provides for calculation and notice to the tenant of its amount.
 

(b) Any lodging unless it contains its own cooking and toilet facilities, separate from other living quarters.
 

(c) Any room in a hotel or motel.
 

(d) Any concession within a larger commercial enterprise, or any other property not customarily used separately from adjacent units.
 

(e) Any property for which the rent is a share of sales or profit.
 

4. The statements required in July 1981 by subsection 1 must show, in addition to the information required as of the date the statement is prepared, the comparable information as of July 1980. Each landlord of property which is subject to this section shall reduce the periodic rent otherwise payable by an amount equal to 90 percent of any reduction from 1980 to 1981 of the amount which represents property taxes as shown in the statements required by that subsection.
 

5. This section does not purport to regulate the total amount of rent payable.
 

6. A landlord who fails to reduce the periodic rent in accordance with subsection 4 is liable to each tenant whose rent was not properly reduced for an amount equal to three times the amount which was overpaid by the tenant, unless the landlord shows good cause for the failure. If the tenant made written demand upon his or her landlord at least 20 days before bringing his or her action under this subsection, a judgment for the tenant must include costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee.
 

7. The Department of Taxation is responsible for enforcing the provisions of this section.

Abandonment of Real Property by Tenant
N.R.S. 118.175
118.175. Liability of tenant
Currentness


If a tenant of real property abandons the property, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it at a fair rental. If the landlord rents the property for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement pursuant to its terms or if, despite the landlord’s reasonable efforts, the landlord is unable to rent the property before the rental agreement is otherwise terminated, the former tenant is liable for any actual damages of the landlord which may result from the abandonment. If the landlord fails to make reasonable efforts to rent the property at a fair rental, the former tenant is liable for any actual damages of the landlord occurring before the landlord had reason to believe that the property was abandoned. If the tenancy is from month to month or week to week, the term of the rental agreement for this purpose is deemed to be a month or a week, as the case may be.

Abandonment of Real Property by Tenant
N.R.S. 118.195
118.195. Notice to tenant of landlord’s belief that property has been abandoned; property deemed abandoned unless disputed by tenant
Currentness


1. If a landlord of real property reasonably believes that his or her tenant has abandoned the property, and the tenant is in default in the payment of rent, the landlord may serve the tenant with a written notice of the landlord’s belief that the property has been abandoned. If the tenant fails, within 5 days after service of the notice by the landlord, to:
 

(a) Pay the rent due; and
 

(b) Provide the landlord with a written notice:
 

(1) Stating the tenant’s intention not to abandon the property; and
 

(2) Setting forth an address at which the tenant may be served with legal process,
 

the property shall be deemed abandoned by the tenant and the rental agreement shall be deemed terminated. The property shall not be deemed abandoned if the tenant pays the rent due and provides the written notice within the prescribed time.
 

2. Real property shall not be deemed abandoned pursuant to this section if the tenant proves that at the time the landlord served notice:
 

(a) The tenant was not in default in the payment of rent; or
 

(b) It was not reasonable for the landlord to believe that the tenant had abandoned the real property. The fact that the landlord knew that the tenant left personal property on the real property does not, of itself, justify a finding that the landlord did not reasonably believe that the tenant had abandoned the real property.
 

3. The provisions of this section do not preclude a landlord or tenant from otherwise proving that real property has been abandoned.
