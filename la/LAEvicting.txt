INTRODUCTION--1960

These articles were drawn from former R.S. 13:4911, dealing with “occupants holding by accommodation of the owner or any other occupant” and 13:4918, dealing with persons as to whom the lessor-lessee relationship exists. As to the procedure after the initial notices, there is provided one system applicable to both of these basic situations, drawn from former R.S. 13:4911-13:4916 and 13:4918-13:4925.

SUMMARY OF PROCEDURAL CHANGES IN TITLE 11--1960

By Henry G. McMahon
 

1. Three changes in the procedural rules are made by Art. 4701. First, the notice to vacate must allow the tenant or occupant at least 5 days to vacate in all cases. Under the prior law, the vacate notice had to allow at least 5, 10, or 30 days, dependent on the circumstances. Second, in the case of a lease having a definite term, this article allows the lessor to anticipate that his tenant will not vacate the premises at the end of the term and to give the necessary vacate notice prior to its expiration, so that court action may be taken as soon as the term has ended. Third, the lessor is prevented, in cases where the lease is for a definite term, from giving notice to vacate in the lease itself.
 

2. Art. 4733 changes the procedural law slightly, at least in theory. It suppressed that portion of its source provision which allowed the plaintiff to recover his costs “out of any goods and chattels of the defendant subject to seizure”.
 

3. The limitations upon the right of an appeal which heretofore applied only to a tenant are now made applicable to all occupants by Art. 4735.
 

Caveat
 

In eviction proceedings in a district court (Parish of Orleans excepted) where its jurisdiction is concurrent with that of a justice of the peace, the judge (and not the district court clerk) must render and sign the eviction judgment, even though the defendant may not appear. Arts. 4732, 4972.

LSA-C.C.P. Art. 4701
Art. 4701. Termination of lease; notice to vacate; waiver of notice
Currentness


When a lessee’s right of occupancy has ceased because of the termination of the lease by expiration of its term, action by the lessor, nonpayment of rent, or for any other reason, and the lessor wishes to obtain possession of the premises, the lessor or his agent shall cause written notice to vacate the premises to be delivered to the lessee. The notice shall allow the lessee not less than five days from the date of its delivery to vacate the leased premises.
 

If the lease has no definite term, the notice required by law for its termination shall be considered as a notice to vacate under this Article. If the lease has a definite term, notice to vacate may be given not more than thirty days before the expiration of the term.
 

A lessee may waive the notice requirements of this Article by written waiver contained in the lease, in which case, upon termination of the lessee’s right of occupancy for any reason, the lessor or his agent may immediately institute eviction proceedings in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title XI of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure.

Editors’ Notes
OFFICIAL REVISION COMMENTS

(a) This article covers all cases of termination of lease, regardless of the cause, and fixes a notice period of five days. It represents a change in the prior law under which the notice was five, ten, or thirty days, depending upon the circumstances. The article also permits the lessor in the case of a lease having a fixed term to anticipate that the tenant will not vacate the premises at the end of the term and to give him the necessary notice prior to its expiration, so that he may take court action as soon as the term is over.
 

(b) The word “limitation”, which appears in former R.S. 13:4918, has been omitted. See 2 La.L.Rev. 161 (1940). See, also, 21 Tul.L.Rev. 256 (1946).
 

(c) If the lease has already terminated and the tenant remains on the premises, the substantive problem of reconduction then enters the picture. See 21 Tul.L.Rev. 256 (1946). The above text applies to the “reconducted” lease, which is a new lease and not a continuation of the old lease. See 1 La.L.Rev. 439 (1939). The term of this reconducted lease is fixed by Civil Code Arts. 2686-2691, and it is not necessary to include these substantive provisions in an article on eviction. The notice of ten days provided for by Art. 2686 of the Civil Code is a device to prevent reconduction, and is not to be confused with the ten day notice of eviction, although presumably one notice could serve both purposes.
