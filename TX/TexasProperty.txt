Editors’ Notes
REVISOR’S NOTE
2014 Main Volume

The source law is derived directly from an 1874 statute that was principally concerned with creating an agricultural landlord’s lien. See Chapter 48, page 55, General Laws, Acts of the 14th Legislature, Regular Session, 1874. That lien has been continued in effect without substantial change and is now V.A.C.S. Article 5222 of the source law (Section 54.001). The 1874 Act also contained the statutory antecedents of V.A.C.S. Articles 5223-5231 and 5233-5236. Articles 5228-5231 and 5233-5235, which related to distress warrants available to a holder of the landlord’s lien, have been repealed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which now control the procedural matters relating to distress warrants.
 

V.A.C.S. Article 5237, which provides that a tenant may not sublet the leasehold without the consent of the landlord (Section 91.005), was added to the 1874 statute by amendment in 1876. See Chapter 93, page 137, General Laws, Acts of the 15th Legislature, Regular Session, 1876.
 

It is obvious that the intent of this early legislation was to provide certain agricultural landlords with a preference lien on the property of their tenants, including crops, to secure payment by the tenant of rent due and for advances furnished to make the crops. Certain ancillary matters were also involved, primarily including the distress warrants, which permitted the landlord to seize security in danger of being removed or sold without the landlord’s permission. An additional aspect of the legislation was the grant to a tenant not in default of the statutory right, now found in the source law, to recover damages resulting from the landlord’s breach of the lease, and the grant of a lien to secure the recovery. The right of the tenant to recover damages merely restated the preexisting and well-established common law of contracts.
 

The 1874 law was separated into its components, each of which was given an article number in the statutory revision of 1911. Although the source law and the other provisions derived from the 1874 law have been renumbered in each statutory revision since 1911, their substance has remained basically unchanged.
 

What has changed, however, in regard to Articles 5236 and 5237 is that by being detached from their original context their meaning has been broadened. Although both articles clearly are derived from legislation relating to specific tenancies, i.e., agricultural, and although their language referring to “the landlord,” “the tenant,” “the contract,” “said lands or tenements,” and “said lease” are historically and logically references to the agricultural landlord and tenant situation now governed by Article 5222, that specific and limited application is not the way the statutes are commonly understood and applied today. It appears that both Articles 5236 and 5237 are applied generally, and without distinction, to all tenancies, whether urban, rural, commercial, or residential.
 

Neither statute has had a substantial case-law impact. Since the right of a tenant to damages on breach of a lease by a landlord is axiomatic, the heart of Article 5236 is the tenant’s lien. However, tenants have only infrequently attempted to enforce it. Article 5237 has been cited with more regularity, but the citations are almost always very summary dicta since most written leases contain prohibitions, against subletting without the landlord’s permission.
 

In order to be consistent with the long-standing practice of the courts, the bar, and the public, the revised law has not expressly limited the application of Articles 5236 and 5237 to agricultural tenancies, and places the revisions in this chapter, with its implication of general applicability, rather than in Chapter 54, where the other provisions of the related source law have been revised.

Editors’ Notes
REVISOR’S NOTE
2014 Main Volume

(1) The revised law does not define “rental agreement” because the revised law uses the synonym “lease” and because the source law defined the term according to its usual and commonly understood meaning. The limited application of the term to residential leases is maintained in the revised law in the definition of “dwelling,” and in Section 92.002.
 

(2) The revised law omits the reference to “invitee” in the source law definition of “normal wear and tear” because in this context “guest” and “invitee” have the same meaning.

§ 92.009. Residential Tenant’s Right of Reentry After Unlawful Lockout
Effective: September 1, 2011
Currentness


(a) If a landlord has locked a tenant out of leased premises in violation of Section 92.0081, the tenant may recover possession of the premises as provided by this section.
 

(b) The tenant must file with the justice court in the precinct in which the rental premises are located a sworn complaint for reentry, specifying the facts of the alleged unlawful lockout by the landlord or the landlord’s agent. The tenant must also state orally under oath to the justice the facts of the alleged unlawful lockout.
 

(c) If the tenant has complied with Subsection (b) and if the justice reasonably believes an unlawful lockout has likely occurred, the justice may issue, ex parte, a writ of reentry that entitles the tenant to immediate and temporary possession of the premises, pending a final hearing on the tenant’s sworn complaint for reentry.
 

(d) The writ of reentry must be served on either the landlord or the landlord’s management company, on-premises manager, or rent collector in the same manner as a writ of possession in a forcible detainer action. A sheriff or constable may use reasonable force in executing a writ of reentry under this section.
 

(e) The landlord is entitled to a hearing on the tenant’s sworn complaint for reentry. The writ of reentry must notify the landlord of the right to a hearing. The hearing shall be held not earlier than the first day and not later than the seventh day after the date the landlord requests a hearing.
 

(f) If the landlord fails to request a hearing on the tenant’s sworn complaint for reentry before the eighth day after the date of service of the writ of reentry on the landlord under Subsection (d), a judgment for court costs may be rendered against the landlord.
 

(g) A party may appeal from the court’s judgment at the hearing on the sworn complaint for reentry in the same manner as a party may appeal a judgment in a forcible detainer suit.
 

(h) If a writ of possession is issued, it supersedes a writ of reentry.
 

(i) If the landlord or the person on whom a writ of reentry is served fails to immediately comply with the writ or later disobeys the writ, the failure is grounds for contempt of court against the landlord or the person on whom the writ was served, under Section 21.002, Government Code. If the writ is disobeyed, the tenant or the tenant’s attorney may file in the court in which the reentry action is pending an affidavit stating the name of the person who has disobeyed the writ and describing the acts or omissions constituting the disobedience. On receipt of an affidavit, the justice shall issue a show cause order, directing the person to appear on a designated date and show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt of court. If the justice finds, after considering the evidence at the hearing, that the person has directly or indirectly disobeyed the writ, the justice may commit the person to jail without bail until the person purges himself of the contempt in a manner and form as the justice may direct. If the person disobeyed the writ before receiving the show cause order but has complied with the writ after receiving the order, the justice may find the person in contempt and assess punishment under Section 21.002(c), Government Code.
 

(j) This section does not affect a tenant’s right to pursue a separate cause of action under Section 92.0081.
 

(k) If a tenant in bad faith files a sworn complaint for reentry resulting in a writ of reentry being served on the landlord or landlord’s agent, the landlord may in a separate cause of action recover from the tenant an amount equal to actual damages, one month’s rent or $500, whichever is greater, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs of court, less any sums for which the landlord is liable to the tenant.
 

(l) The fee for filing a sworn complaint for reentry is the same as that for filing a civil action in justice court. The fee for service of a writ of reentry is the same as that for service of a writ of possession. The fee for service of a show cause order is the same as that for service of a civil citation. The justice may defer payment of the tenant’s filing fees and service costs for the sworn complaint for reentry and writ of reentry. Court costs may be waived only if the tenant executes a pauper’s affidavit.
 

(m) This section does not affect the rights of a landlord or tenant in a forcible detainer or forcible entry and detainer action.

(a) This section applies only to a tenant in a multiunit complex, as that term is defined by Section 92.151.
 

(b) If at the time a lease agreement is executed a landlord has vehicle towing or parking rules or policies that apply to the tenant, the landlord shall provide to the tenant a copy of the rules or policies before the lease agreement is executed. The copy of the rules or policies must be:
 

(1) signed by the tenant;
 

(2) included in a lease agreement signed by the tenant; or
 

(3) included in an attachment to the lease agreement that is signed by the tenant, but only if the attachment is expressly referred to in the lease agreement.
 

(c) If the rules or policies are contained in the lease agreement or an attachment to the lease agreement, the title to the paragraph containing the rules or policies must read “Parking” or “Parking Rules” and be capitalized, underlined, or printed in bold print.
 

(c-1) As a precondition for allowing a tenant to park in a specific parking space or a common parking area that the landlord has made available for tenant use, the landlord may require a tenant to provide only the make, model, color, year, license number, and state of registration of the vehicle to be parked.
 

(c-2) Notwithstanding Subsection (c-1), a municipal housing authority located in a municipality that has a population of more than 500,000 and is not more than 50 miles from an international border, or a public facility corporation, affiliate, or subsidiary of the authority, may require that vehicles parked in a community of the authority, corporation, affiliate, or subsidiary be registered with the housing authority.
 

(d) If a landlord changes the vehicle towing or parking rules or policies during the term of the lease agreement, the landlord shall provide written notice of the change to the tenant before the tenant is required to comply with the rule or policy change. The landlord has the burden of proving that the tenant received a copy of the rule or policy change. The landlord may satisfy that burden of proof by providing evidence that the landlord:
 

(1) delivered the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the tenant at the tenant’s dwelling; or
 

(2) made a notation in the landlord’s files of the time, place, and method of providing the notice and the name of the person who delivered the notice by:

(C) taping the notice to the inside of the main entry door of the tenant’s dwelling.
 

(e) If a rule or policy change is made during the term of the lease agreement, the change:
 

(1) must:
 

(A) apply to all of the landlord’s tenants in the same multiunit complex and be based on necessity, safety or security of tenants, reasonable requirements for construction on the premises, or respect for other tenants’ parking rights; or
 

(B) be adopted based on the tenant’s written consent; and
 

(2) may not be effective before the 14th day after the date notice of the change is delivered to the tenant, unless the change is the result of a construction or utility emergency.
 

(f) A landlord who violates Subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) is liable for a civil penalty in the amount of $100 plus any towing or storage costs that the tenant incurs as a result of the towing of the tenant’s vehicle. The nonprevailing party in a suit under this section is liable to the prevailing party for reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.
 

(g) A landlord is liable for any damage to a tenant’s vehicle resulting from the negligence of a towing service that contracts with the landlord or the landlord’s agent to remove vehicles that are parked in violation of the landlord’s rules and policies if the towing company that caused the damage does not carry insurance that covers the damage.

(a) For purposes of this section, “ dependent,” “military service,” and “servicemember” have the meanings assigned by 50 App. U.S.C. Section 511.
 

(b) A tenant who is a servicemember or a dependent of a servicemember may vacate the dwelling leased by the tenant and avoid liability for future rent and all other sums due under the lease for terminating the lease and vacating the dwelling before the end of the lease term if:
 

(1) the lease was executed by or on behalf of a person who, after executing the lease or during the term of the lease, enters military service; or

(B) to deploy with a military unit for a period of 90 days or more.
 

(c) A tenant who terminates a lease under Subsection (b) shall deliver to the landlord or landlord’s agent:
 

(1) a written notice of termination of the lease; and
 

(2) a copy of an appropriate government document providing evidence of the tenant’s entrance into military service if Subsection (b)(1) applies or a copy of the servicemember’s military orders if Subsection (b)(2) applies.
 

(d) Termination of a lease under this section is effective:
 

(1) in the case of a lease that provides for monthly payment of rent, on the 30th day after the first date on which the next rental payment is due after the date on which the notice under Subsection (c)(1) is delivered; or
 

(2) in the case of a lease other than a lease described by Subdivision (1), on the last day of the month following the month in which the notice under Subsection (c)(1) is delivered.
 

(e) A landlord, not later than the 30th day after the effective date of the termination of a lease under this section, shall refund to the residential tenant terminating the lease under Subsection (b) all rent or other amounts paid in advance under the lease for any period after the effective date of the termination of the lease.
 

(f) Except as provided by Subsection (g), this section does not affect a tenant’s liability for delinquent, unpaid rent or other sums owed to the landlord before the lease was terminated by the tenant under this section.
 

(g) A tenant who terminates a lease under Subsection (b) is released from all liability for any delinquent, unpaid rent owed to the landlord by the tenant on the effective date of the lease termination if the lease does not contain language substantially equivalent to the following:
 

“Tenants may have special statutory rights to terminate the lease early in certain situations involving family violence or a military deployment or transfer.”
 

(h) A landlord who violates this section is liable to the tenant for actual damages, a civil penalty in an amount equal to the amount of one month’s rent plus $500, and attorney’s fees.

A waiver under this section must be signed and in writing in a document separate from the lease and must comply with federal law. A waiver under this section does not apply if:
 

(1) the tenant or the tenant’s dependent moves into housing owned or occupied by family or relatives of the tenant or the tenant’s dependent; or
 

(2) the tenant and the tenant’s dependent move, wholly or partly, because of a significant financial loss of income caused by the tenant’s military service.
 

(k) For purposes of Subsection (j), “significant financial loss of income” means a reduction of 10 percent or more of the tenant’s household income caused by the tenant’s military service. A landlord is entitled to verify the significant financial loss of income in order to determine whether a tenant is entitled to terminate a lease if the tenant has signed a waiver under this section and moves within 30 miles of the dwelling into housing that is not owned or occupied by family or relatives of the tenant or the tenant’s dependent. For purposes of this subsection, a pay stub or other statement of earnings issued by the tenant’s employer is sufficient verification.

(a) A landlord’s liability under this section is subject to Section 92.052(b) regarding conditions that are caused by a tenant and Section 92.054 regarding conditions that are insured casualties.
 

(b) A landlord is liable to a tenant as provided by this subchapter if:
 

(1) the tenant has given the landlord notice to repair or remedy a condition by giving that notice to the person to whom or to the place where the tenant’s rent is normally paid;
 

(2) the condition materially affects the physical health or safety of an ordinary tenant;
 

(3) the tenant has given the landlord a subsequent written notice to repair or remedy the condition after a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition following the notice given under Subdivision (1) or the tenant has given the notice under Subdivision (1) by sending that notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, by registered mail, or by another form of mail that allows tracking of delivery from the United States Postal Service or a private delivery service;
 

(4) the landlord has had a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition after the landlord received the tenant’s notice under Subdivision (1) and, if applicable, the tenant’s subsequent notice under Subdivision (3);
 

(5) the landlord has not made a diligent effort to repair or remedy the condition after the landlord received the tenant’s notice under Subdivision (1) and, if applicable, the tenant’s notice under Subdivision (3); and
 

(6) the tenant was not delinquent in the payment of rent at the time any notice required by this subsection was given.
 

(c) For purposes of Subsection (b)(4) or (5), a landlord is considered to have received the tenant’s notice when the landlord or the landlord’s agent or employee has actually received the notice or when the United States Postal Service has attempted to deliver the notice to the landlord.
 

(d) For purposes of Subsection (b)(3) or (4), in determining whether a period of time is a reasonable time to repair or remedy a condition, there is a rebuttable presumption that seven days is a reasonable time. To rebut that presumption, the date on which the landlord received the tenant’s notice, the severity and nature of the condition, and the reasonable availability of materials and labor and of utilities from a utility company must be considered.
 

(e) Except as provided in Subsection (f), a tenant to whom a landlord is liable under Subsection (b) of this section may:
 

(1) terminate the lease;
 

(2) have the condition repaired or remedied according to Section 92.0561;
 

(3) deduct from the tenant’s rent, without necessity of judicial action, the cost of the repair or remedy according to Section 92.0561; and
 

(4) obtain judicial remedies according to Section 92.0563.
 

(f) A tenant who elects to terminate the lease under Subsection (e) is:
 

(1) entitled to a pro rata refund of rent from the date of termination or the date the tenant moves out, whichever is later;
 

(2) entitled to deduct the tenant’s security deposit from the tenant’s rent without necessity of lawsuit or obtain a refund of the tenant’s security deposit according to law; and
 

(3) not entitled to the other repair and deduct remedies under Section 92.0561 or the judicial remedies under Subdivisions (1) and (2) of Subsection (a) of Section 92.0563.
 

(g) A lease must contain language in underlined or bold print that informs the tenant of the remedies available under this section and Section 92.0561.

However, if the tenant’s rent is subsidized in whole or in part by a governmental agency, the deduction limitation of one month’s rent shall mean the fair market rent for the dwelling and not the rent that the tenant pays. The fair market rent shall be determined by the governmental agency subsidizing the rent, or in the absence of such a determination, it shall be a reasonable amount of rent under the circumstances.
 

(c) Repairs and deductions under this section may be made as often as necessary so long as the total repairs and deductions in any one month do not exceed one month’s rent or $500, whichever is greater.
 

(d) Repairs under this section may be made only if all of the following requirements are met:
 

(1) The landlord has a duty to repair or remedy the condition under Section 92.052, and the duty has not been waived in a written lease by the tenant under Subsection (e) or (f) of Section 92.006.
 

(2) The tenant has given notice to the landlord as required by Section 92.056(b)(1), and, if required, a subsequent notice under Section 92.056(b)(3), and at least one of those notices states that the tenant intends to repair or remedy the condition. The notice shall also contain a reasonable description of the intended repair or remedy.
 

(3) Any one of the following events has occurred:
 

(A) The landlord has failed to remedy the backup or overflow of raw sewage inside the tenant’s dwelling or the flooding from broken pipes or natural drainage inside the dwelling.
 

(B) The landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed in the lease to furnish potable water to the tenant’s dwelling and the water service to the dwelling has totally ceased.
 

(C) The landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed in the lease to furnish heating or cooling equipment; the equipment is producing inadequate heat or cooled air; and the landlord has been notified in writing by the appropriate local housing, building, or health official or other official having jurisdiction that the lack of heat or cooling materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.
 

(D) The landlord has been notified in writing by the appropriate local housing, building, or health official or other official having jurisdiction that the condition materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.
 

(e) If the requirements of Subsection (d) of this section are met, a tenant may:
 

(1) have the condition repaired or remedied immediately following the tenant’s notice of intent to repair if the condition involves sewage or flooding as referred to in Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section;
 

(2) have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition involves a cessation of potable water as referred to in Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and if the landlord has failed to repair or remedy the condition within three days following the tenant’s delivery of notice of intent to repair;
 

(3) have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition involves inadequate heat or cooled air as referred to in Paragraph (C) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and if the landlord has failed to repair the condition within three days after delivery of the tenant’s notice of intent to repair; or
 

(4) have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition is not covered by Paragraph (A), (B), or (C) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and involves a condition affecting the physical health or safety of the ordinary tenant as referred to in Paragraph (D) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and if the landlord has failed to repair or remedy the condition within seven days after delivery of the tenant’s notice of intent to repair.
 

(f) Repairs made pursuant to the tenant’s notice must be made by a company, contractor, or repairman listed in the yellow or business pages of the telephone directory or in the classified advertising section of a newspaper of the local city, county, or adjacent county at the time of the tenant’s notice of intent to repair. Unless the landlord and tenant agree otherwise under Subsection (g) of this section, repairs may not be made by the tenant, the tenant’s immediate family, the tenant’s employer or employees, or a company in which the tenant has an ownership interest. Repairs may not be made to the foundation or load-bearing structural elements of the building if it contains two or more dwelling units.
 

(g) A landlord and a tenant may mutually agree for the tenant to repair or remedy, at the landlord’s expense, any condition of the dwelling regardless of whether it materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant. However, the landlord’s duty to repair or remedy conditions covered by this subchapter may not be waived except as provided by Subsection (e) or (f) of Section 92.006.
 

(h) Repairs made pursuant to the tenant’s notice must be made in compliance with applicable building codes, including a building permit when required.
 

(i) The tenant shall not have authority to contract for labor or materials in excess of what the tenant may deduct under this section. The landlord is not liable to repairmen, contractors, or material suppliers who furnish labor or materials to repair or remedy the condition. A repairman or supplier shall not have a lien for materials or services arising out of repairs contracted for by the tenant under this section.
 

(j) When deducting the cost of repairs from the rent payment, the tenant shall furnish the landlord, along with payment of the balance of the rent, a copy of the repair bill and the receipt for its payment. A repair bill and receipt may be the same document.
 

(k) If the landlord repairs or remedies the condition or delivers an affidavit for delay under Section 92.0562 to the tenant after the tenant has contacted a repairman but before the repairman commences work, the landlord shall be liable for the cost incurred by the tenant for the repairman’s trip charge, and the tenant may deduct the charge from the tenant’s rent as if it were a repair cost.

§ 92.0562. Landlord Affidavit for Delay
Currentness


(a) The tenant must delay contracting for repairs under Section 92.0561 if, before the tenant contracts for the repairs, the landlord delivers to the tenant an affidavit, signed and sworn to under oath by the landlord or his authorized agent and complying with this section.
 

(b) The affidavit must summarize the reasons for the delay and the diligent efforts made by the landlord up to the date of the affidavit to get the repairs done. The affidavit must state facts showing that the landlord has made and is making diligent efforts to repair the condition, and it must contain dates, names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contractors, suppliers, and repairmen contacted by the owner.
 

(c) Affidavits under this section may delay repair by the tenant for:
 

(1) 15 days if the landlord’s failure to repair is caused by a delay in obtaining necessary parts for which the landlord is not at fault; or
 

(2) 30 days if the landlord’s failure to repair is caused by a general shortage of labor or materials for repair following a natural disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, extended freeze, or widespread windstorm.
 

(d) Affidavits for delay based on grounds other than those listed in Subsection (c) of this section are unlawful, and if used, they are of no effect. The landlord may file subsequent affidavits, provided that the total delay of the repair or remedy extends no longer than six months from the date the landlord delivers the first affidavit to the tenant.
 

(e) The affidavit must be delivered to the tenant by any of the following methods:
 

(1) personal delivery to the tenant;
 

(2) certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant; or
 

(3) leaving the notice inside the dwelling in a conspicuous place if notice in that manner is authorized in a written lease.
 

(f) Affidavits for delay by a landlord under this section must be submitted in good faith. Following delivery of the affidavit, the landlord must continue diligent efforts to repair or remedy the condition. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted in good faith and with continued diligence for the first affidavit for delay the landlord delivers to the tenant. The landlord shall have the burden of pleading and proving good faith and continued diligence for subsequent affidavits for delay. A landlord who violates this section shall be liable to the tenant for all judicial remedies under Section 92.0563 except that the civil penalty under Subdivision (3) of Subsection (a) of Section 92.0563 shall be one month’s rent plus $1,000.
 

(g) If the landlord is liable to the tenant under Section 92.056 and if a new landlord, in good faith and without knowledge of the tenant’s notice of intent to repair, has acquired title to the tenant’s dwelling by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or general warranty deed in a bona fide purchase, then the following shall apply:
 

(1) The tenant’s right to terminate the lease under this subchapter shall not be affected, and the tenant shall have no duty to give additional notice to the new landlord.
 

(2) The tenant’s right to repair and deduct for conditions involving sewage backup or overflow, flooding inside the dwelling, or a cutoff of potable water under Subsection (e) of Section 92.0561 shall not be affected, and the tenant shall have no duty to give additional notice to the new landlord.
 

(3) For conditions other than those specified in Subdivision (2) of this subsection, if the new landlord acquires title as described in this subsection and has notified the tenant of the name and address of the new landlord or the new landlord’s authorized agent and if the tenant has not already contracted for the repair or remedy at the time the tenant is so notified, the tenant must deliver to the new landlord a written notice of intent to repair or remedy the condition, and the new landlord shall have a reasonable time to complete the repair before the tenant may repair or remedy the condition. No further notice from the tenant is necessary in order for the tenant to repair or remedy the condition after a reasonable time has elapsed.
 

(4) The tenant’s judicial remedies under Section 92.0563 shall be limited to recovery against the landlord to whom the tenant gave the required notices until the tenant has given the new landlord the notices required by this section and otherwise complied with Section 92.056 as to the new landlord.
 

(5) If the new landlord violates this subsection, the new landlord is liable to the tenant for a civil penalty of one month’s rent plus $2,000, actual damages, and attorney’s fees.
 

(6) No provision of this section shall affect any right of a foreclosing superior lienholder to terminate, according to law, any interest in the premises held by the holders of subordinate liens, encumbrances, leases, or other interests and shall not affect any right of the tenant to terminate the lease according to law.

§ 92.0563. Tenant’s Judicial Remedies
Effective: August 31, 2013
Currentness


(a) A tenant’s judicial remedies under Section 92.056 shall include:
 

(1) an order directing the landlord to take reasonable action to repair or remedy the condition;
 

(2) an order reducing the tenant’s rent, from the date of the first repair notice, in proportion to the reduced rental value resulting from the condition until the condition is repaired or remedied;
 

(3) a judgment against the landlord for a civil penalty of one month’s rent plus $500;
 

(4) a judgment against the landlord for the amount of the tenant’s actual damages; and
 

(5) court costs and attorney’s fees, excluding any attorney’s fees for a cause of action for damages relating to a personal injury.
 

(b) A landlord who knowingly violates Section 92.006 by contracting orally or in writing with a tenant to waive the landlord’s duty to repair under this subchapter shall be liable to the tenant for actual damages, a civil penalty of one month’s rent plus $2,000, and reasonable attorney’s fees. For purposes of this subsection, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted without knowledge of the violation. The tenant shall have the burden of pleading and proving a knowing violation. If the lease is in writing and is not in violation of Section 92.006, the tenant’s proof of a knowing violation must be clear and convincing. A mutual agreement for tenant repair under Subsection (g) of Section 92.0561 is not a violation of Section 92.006.
 

(c) The justice, county, and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction in an action under Subsection (a).
 

(d) If a suit is filed in a justice court requesting relief under Subsection (a), the justice court shall conduct a hearing on the request not earlier than the sixth day after the date of service of citation and not later than the 10th day after that date.
 

(e) A justice court may not award a judgment under this section, including an order of repair, that exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs of court.
 

(f) An appeal of a judgment of a justice court under this section takes precedence in county court and may be held at any time after the eighth day after the date the transcript is filed in the county court. An owner of real property who files a notice of appeal of a judgment of a justice court to the county court perfects the owner’s appeal and stays the effect of the judgment without the necessity of posting an appeal bond.

REVISOR’S NOTE
2014 Main Volume

(1) The revised law uses the term “dwelling” instead of “residence” in order to have consistent terminology throughout the chapter. There is no substantive difference in meaning.
 

(2) The source law is purportedly a definition of security deposit. The revised law makes this a substantive provision in order to emphasize its importance and avoid an artificial definition.

§ 92.162. Payment of Charges; Limits on Amount Charged
Currentness


(a) A landlord may not require a tenant to pay for repair or replacement of a security device due to normal wear and tear. A landlord may not require a tenant to pay for other repairs or replacements of a security device except as provided by Subsections (b), (c), and (d).
 

(b) A landlord may require a tenant to pay for repair or replacement of a security device if an underlined provision in a written lease authorizes the landlord to do so and the repair or replacement is necessitated by misuse or damage by the tenant, a member of the tenant’s family, an occupant, or a guest, and not by normal wear and tear. Misuse of or damage to a security device that occurs during the tenant’s occupancy is presumed to be caused by the tenant, a family member, an occupant, or a guest. The tenant has the burden of proving that the misuse or damage was caused by another party.
 

(c) A landlord may require a tenant to pay in advance charges for which the tenant is liable under this subchapter if a written lease authorizes the landlord to require advance payment, and the landlord notifies the tenant within a reasonable time after the tenant’s request that advance payment is required, and:
 

(1) the tenant is more than 30 days delinquent in reimbursing the landlord for charges to which the landlord is entitled under Subsection (b); or
 

(2) the tenant requested that the landlord repair, install, change, or rekey the same security device during the 30 days preceding the tenant’s request, and the landlord complied with the request.
 

(d) A landlord authorized by this subchapter to charge a tenant for repairing, installing, changing, or rekeying a security device under this subchapter may not require the tenant to pay more than the total cost charged by a third-party contractor for material, labor, taxes, and extra keys. If the landlord’s employees perform the work, the charge may include a reasonable amount for overhead but may not include a profit to the landlord. If management company employees perform the work, the charge may include reasonable overhead and profit but may not exceed the cost charged to the owner by the management company for comparable security devices installed by management company employees at the owner’s request and expense.
 

(e) The owner of a dwelling shall reimburse a management company, managing agent, or on-site manager for costs expended by that person in complying with this subchapter. A management company, managing agent, or on-site manager may reimburse itself for the costs from the owner’s funds in its possession or control.

(2) the landlord is not required to install a doorknob lock or keyed dead bolt at the landlord’s expense if the exterior doors meet the requirements of Section 92.153(f);
 

(3) the landlord is not required to install a keyless bolting device at the landlord’s expense on an exterior door if the landlord is expressly required or permitted to periodically check on the well-being or health of the tenant as provided by Section 92.153(e)(3); and
 

(4) the tenant has the right to install or rekey a security device required by this subchapter and deduct the reasonable cost from the tenant’s next rent payment, as provided by Subsection (a)(1).
