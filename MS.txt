Resident aliens may acquire and hold land, and may dispose of it and transmit it by descent, as citizens of the state may. Except as otherwise provided in this section, nonresident aliens shall not hereafter acquire or hold land, but a nonresident alien may have or take a lien on land to secure a debt, and at any sale thereof to enforce payment of the debt may purchase the same, and thereafter hold it, not longer than twenty (20) years, with full power during said time to sell the land, in fee, to a citizen; or he may retain it by becoming a citizen within that time. All land held or acquired contrary to this section shall escheat to the state; but a title to real estate in the name of a citizen of the United States, or a person who has declared his intention of becoming a citizen, whether resident or nonresident, if he be a purchaser or holder, shall not be forfeited or escheated by reason of the alienage of any former owner or other person.
 

Any person who was or is a citizen of the United States and became or becomes an alien by reason of marriage to a citizen of a foreign country, may hereafter inherit, or if he or she heretofore inherited or acquired or hereafter inherits, may hold, own, transmit by descent or transfer land free from any escheat to the State of Mississippi, if said land has not heretofore escheated by final valid order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
 

Nonresident aliens who are citizens of Syria or the Lebanese Republic may inherit property from citizens or residents of the State of Mississippi.
 

Nonresident aliens may acquire and hold not to exceed three hundred twenty (320) acres of land in this state for the purpose of industrial development thereon. In addition, any nonresident alien may acquire and hold not to exceed five (5) acres of land for residential purposes. The nonresident alien may dispose of any such land, but if any land acquired for industrial development ceases to be used for industrial development while owned by a nonresident alien, it shall escheat to the state. The limitation set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to corporations in which the stock thereof is partially or wholly owned by nonresident aliens.

Currentness


A conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance upon a homestead exempted from execution shall not be valid or binding unless signed by the spouse of the owner if the owner is married and living with the spouse or by an attorney in fact for the spouse. But where the spouse of the owner of the homestead exempted from execution has been adjudicated incompetent, then the owner of the homestead may file a petition in the chancery court and allege in the petition the incompetence of the spouse and the adjudication of incompetency of the spouse and the facts of the case. The summons for the spouse who has been adjudicated incompetent shall be issued and be served in the same manner as process is served in other cases on persons who are incompetent. The court shall hear the case in vacation or in termtime as in other cases, and if the court finds the spouse to be incompetent and the owner entitled to relief, the court by decree shall authorize and empower the owner to execute a conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance upon the homestead without the signature of the spouse. However, no mortgage or deed of trust executed in favor of the Farmers Home Administration at the time of the purchase of real estate to secure the payment of the money used to purchase the real estate shall be invalid because it is not signed by the spouse of the owner. All powers of attorney authorizing any conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance upon a homestead shall designate an attorney in fact other than the spouse and shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 3 of Title 87.

Relief from Inequitable Mortgage Foreclosures, Execution Sales and the like After Declared Emergency or Disaster
Miss. Code Ann. § 89-1-301
§ 89-1-301. Application; preliminary injunction
Currentness


The provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall apply only in the event that the President of the United States has declared that an emergency or major disaster exists in this state and shall apply only to persons or property directly damaged in an enemy attack, or a man-made, technological or natural disaster declared by the governor in which Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 was specifically included as a relief measure for those counties covered by such disaster declaration. The provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall apply to any mortgage or deed of trust on real property executed prior to the date of the disaster declaration by the governor, and to any such instruments executed after the date of the disaster declaration by the governor which renewed or extended any mortgage or deed of trust executed prior to the date of the disaster declaration by the governor. When the mortgagee, or owner, or holder, or trustee, or other person having like power shall hereafter determine to foreclose a mortgage or deed of trust on real estate covered by the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, he may proceed by bill in chancery, and in the same manner as in proceedings to foreclose under existing statutes in cases where the mortgage or deed of trust contains no provisions for sale by a trustee or otherwise. Any stipulations in the mortgage or deed of trust as to the manner of foreclosure thereunder shall not preclude proceedings to foreclose any mortgage or deed of trust under the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329. If any mortgagee, holder, owner, trustee, or other person shall attempt to foreclose otherwise than as herein provided, such proceedings may be enjoined by the mortgagor or owner in possessing of the mortgaged premises, or anyone claiming under the mortgagor, or anyone liable for the mortgage debt. Upon the filing of a sworn petition which affirmatively sets forth that neither the petitioner nor any other person owning an interest in the legal title to the mortgaged premises is able to pay the sums in arrears on the mortgaged debt, that no such person or persons have been able to secure a refinancing of the mortgaged debt up to the date of the filing of the petition, after diligent effort, and that because of the destruction of or damage to improvements on the mortgaged premises or because of economic conditions brought about by the effects of such an enemy attack or man-made, technological or natural disaster declared by the governor, the mortgaged property has depreciated in value as a proximate result of said disaster in an amount in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of its fair market value prior to said disaster, the chancellor of any chancery court of competent jurisdiction shall issue a preliminary injunction enjoining any foreclosure proceedings which have been commenced. The chancellor shall likewise issue a preliminary injunction enjoining any foreclosure proceedings which have been commenced if a sworn petition shall be filed which affirmatively sets forth that as a direct and proximate result of said disaster the petitioner or any other person owning an interest in the legal title to the mortgaged premises is unable to pay the sums in arrears on the mortgage debt, that the petitioner or such other person or persons have not been able to secure the refinancing of the mortgage debt up to the date of the filing of the petition after diligent effort, and that the petitioner has actually sustained a loss in income derived from the mortgaged property, or is presently threatened with such loss as a proximate result of such disaster, in an amount in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the average annual income from the mortgaged property for the three (3) years immediately prior to said disaster; provided, however, for mortgages or deeds of trust on real property leased or rented for residential purposes from the mortgagor to a third party or parties, the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall apply only if the mortgagor or landlord has made or is making a good-faith effort to rehabilitate the property to a reasonable standard of habitability.
 

Upon the issuance of any such preliminary injunction, the mortgagee may file a motion to dissolve said injunction, which motion shall be heard in termtime or in vacation, at a time to be fixed by the court not less than thirty (30) days from the date of the filing thereof. The mortgagor may implead any and all persons owning or claiming an interest in the legal title to said property and all persons who may be primarily or secondarily liable on the mortgaged indebtedness. Process shall be issued for all parties so impleaded in the manner now provided by law in suits to confirm titles and the cause shall be triable five (5) days after completion of service of process on all parties. The court may grant such continuances as may be necessary for the completion of service of process on all parties.
 

Upon the hearing of the motion to dissolve, unless the petitioner shall prove all of the material allegations of his petition by a preponderance of the evidence, the preliminary injunction shall be dissolved. No injunction bond shall be required for the issuance of the preliminary injunction. If the court shall find the petition was filed solely for the purpose of hindering and delaying collection of the mortgaged debt and without reasonable grounds therefor, reasonable attorney’s fees shall be allowed as in other cases upon dissolution of preliminary injunctions, but not otherwise.
 

If, upon hearing of the motion to dissolve, it shall be determined that said motion should not be granted, then the hearing shall continue in the same manner as provided for in Section 89-1-303, and the court shall enter its order granting the relief provided for by Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 in the case of bills to foreclose. All the terms and provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 relating to the proceedings had on, or to relief granted under, bills to foreclose shall be applicable.
 

Provided, however, if a deed of trust be foreclosed according to the provisions therein contained, and the sale be actually consummated without the mortgagor or his heirs or assigns availing themselves of the right to enjoin said sale as provided in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, the foreclosure and the title resting thereon, if otherwise regular, shall not be controverted on account of any of the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, and this limitation shall also apply to minors and all others under legal disability. The provisions of this section shall apply to advertisements for sales already published at the time of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, but in which the sale has not been made; provided that in such case the costs of the advertisement be tendered in cash with the bill for injunction.

Suits for the foreclosure of mortgages and deeds of trust shall be deemed ready for final hearing at any time after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the completion of the service of legal process on all parties. On the hearing, the court or chancellor in vacation shall receive evidence tending to establish the reasonable, normal, actual value of the mortgaged property, may fix a minimum price or reasonable and equitable price thereon, and shall determine the reasonable value of the income on said property, if any. If it has no income, then the court or chancellor in vacation shall determine the reasonable rental value, and in lieu of a present order of sale shall direct and require the mortgagor or those interested therein to pay all or a reasonable part of said income or rental value to be used for the payment of taxes, insurance and interest on the mortgage indebtedness, together with a reasonable sum for the upkeep of said property. Said payments shall be made at such times and in such manner as shall be fixed and determined and ordered by the court or chancellor in vacation which, according to the circumstances, may appear just and equitable for a term not to extend beyond two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329. After the expiration of two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, if any past due principal, interest, taxes and the like have not been paid, a final order for sale may be made.

If the mortgagor or owner of the mortgaged premises, or other interested person for whose relief Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 are enacted, shall make default in the carrying charge payments, or any of them, required in the order mentioned in the foregoing section, or shall commit any waste, his or her right to a further postponement of a final sale shall terminate thirty (30) days after such default, and the mortgagee or trustee or other persons having the right to foreclose shall thereupon be entitled to apply to the court in termtime or vacation for a final decree of sale upon a satisfactory showing to the court that the default aforesaid has occurred; provided that if the default be explained on the grounds of casualty, inevitable accident, or other good reason wholly beyond the control of the defaulter, and be one which in the judgment of the court can be remedied and made good by the defaulter within a reasonably short period to be fixed by the court, then the court or chancellor in vacation shall have power to excuse the default and to make such order in reference thereto as may be just and equitable. The chancellor shall have power in vacation, at any time after the period mentioned in Section 89-1-303, to hear and determine and to order or decree in respect to any matter that shall arise under Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, to the same extent and as fully as the court could do in termtime, legal notice having been given to all parties of the said hearing in vacation. The court or chancellor in vacation shall have power to revoke the period of extension theretofore granted for the making of the final order of sale in case it may be made to appear to the chancellor in vacation, or to the court in termtime, that the occasion for said postponement no longer exists or is no longer just and reasonable; and, in general, the court, or chancellor in vacation, shall have power to alter and revise its orders theretofore made in any respect insofar as the changed circumstances and conditions may require. Provided further, that prior to two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, no action shall be maintained in this state for a deficiency judgment until the period of time extension allowed in any proceeding begun under the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall have expired.

A failure to disclose such nonmaterial facts or suspicions shall not give rise to a criminal, civil or administrative action against the owner of such real property, a licensed real estate broker or any affiliated licensee of the broker.
 

(2) A failure to disclose in any real estate transaction any information that is provided or maintained, or is required to be provided or maintained, in accordance with Section 45-33-21 through Section 45-33-57, shall not give rise to a cause of action against an owner of real property, a licensed real estate broker or any affiliated licensee of the broker. Likewise, no cause of action shall arise against any licensed real estate broker or affiliated licensee of the broker for revealing information to a seller or buyer of real estate in accordance with Section 45-33-21 through Section 45-33-57. Any factors related to this paragraph, if known to a property owner or licensee shall be disclosed if requested by a consumer.
 

(3) Failure to disclose any of the facts or suspicions of facts described in subsections (1) and (2) shall not be grounds for the termination or rescission of any transaction in which real property has been or will be transferred or leased. This provision does not preclude an action against an owner of real estate who makes intentional or fraudulent misrepresentations in response to a direct inquiry from a purchaser or prospective purchaser regarding facts or suspicions that are not material to the physical condition of the property including, but not limited to, those factors listed in subsections (1) and (2).

The typing or printing of a name or the application of an embossed or inked stamp shall not cover or otherwise materially interfere with any part of the document or instrument except where provided by law. Failure to print or type signatures as required in this paragraph does not invalidate the document or instrument.
 

(f) The first page of each document or instrument, other than a plat or survey or a drawing related to a plat or survey, shall have a top margin of at least three (3) inches of vertical space from left to right which shall be reserved for the recorder’s use.

Title 89. Real and Personal Property
Chapter 5. Recording of Instruments
Article 1. General Provisions
Miss. Code Ann. § 89-5-33
§ 89-5-33. General index; sectional index; indexing instructions
Currentness


(1) The clerk of the chancery court shall provide a general index, direct and reverse, on which shall be entered, in regular alphabetical order under the appropriate letter, the name of each maker of the instrument and the name of each person to whom made; and in like alphabetical order under its appropriate title shall be entered the name of each person to whom the instrument is made and the name of each person by whom made. A general index, both direct and reverse, of mortgages and deeds of trust on land shall be kept separate from the general index to other records which the chancery clerk is required to keep, and he shall make the proper entries in it as he is required to make in the other general index. Immediately on receipt of any instrument to be recorded, the clerk shall make these entries in the appropriate general index and, after recording the instrument, the book and page in which the record is made shall be noted opposite each name thus placed in such general index, both direct and reverse.
 

(2) The clerk of the chancery court shall maintain a sectional index to instruments describing land which are also entered in the general index. Each entry shall state the name of each maker of the instrument, the name of each person to whom made, and the date, type of instrument and the appropriate reference where recorded. Opposite each such entry, the sectional index shall indicate the location of the land described in the instrument (a) by quarter section or governmental lot or other applicable subdivision of each section, township and range established by governmental survey, or (b) by lot number for platted subdivisions, official surveys, and unofficial subdivisions and surveys commonly in use. The clerk may elect to keep the sectional index by quarter-quarter section rather than by the quarter section, but shall not require a preparer’s indexing instruction to describe the quarter-quarter section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, every instrument describing land and required to be entered in the general index shall also be entered in the sectional index. In the event of conflict between the general and the sectional indices, the notice imparted by the general index shall prevail except to the extent the land is described by lot number for platted subdivisions, official surveys, and unofficial subdivisions and surveys commonly in use, the sectional index shall prevail.
 

(3) Every surveyor or other person who prepares a legal description of land or who prepares an instrument utilizing an existing description and every person who prepares a deed of trust shall (except as herein provided) include an indexing instruction which shall state the section, township and range and one or more quarter sections or governmental lots or other applicable subdivisions of each section in which the land is located. The preparer, at his option, may elect to note the quarter-quarter section in which the land is located, but shall not be required to do so. However, if the section or quarter sections or governmental lots or other applicable subdivisions of the section cannot feasibly be determined by such surveyor or other person, the indexing instruction shall contain a statement to that effect and shall then state all of the sections and quarter sections or governmental lots or other applicable subdivisions of the section in which the described land could possibly be located. The indexing instruction shall be distinctly set apart in the instrument so as to be readily apparent to the chancery clerk. A chancery clerk shall refuse to accept delivery of an instrument which does not contain the indexing instruction required in this section unless the instrument otherwise discloses the information required to be included in an indexing instruction. To be accepted for recording, an instrument shall state the name, address and telephone number of the person, entity or firm preparing it. If prepared by an attorney, the instrument shall also include the attorney’s Mississippi bar number. The fact that the indexing instruction or preparer information may be omitted, incorrect, incomplete or false shall not invalidate the instrument or the filing thereof for record. The chancery clerk shall enter the instrument in the sectional index according to the indexing instruction, or equivalent information if accepted for filing without an indexing instruction, and shall make no entries under any other quarter sections or governmental lots or subdivisions of the section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following kinds of instruments shall be indexed as stated:
 

(a) Instruments describing land by reference to officially platted subdivisions or to official surveys or to unofficial subdivisions and surveys commonly in use will not require an indexing instruction and shall be indexed in the general index and the sectional index for such subdivision or survey without further requirement.
 

(b) Instruments describing land or interests in land solely by reference to previously recorded instruments or affecting previously recorded instruments shall not require an indexing instruction and need not be entered in the sectional index but shall be entered in the general index and noted on the margin of the previously recorded instrument. Instruments describing land or interests in land by specific description of certain parcels and, for other parcels, by reference to previously recorded instruments, shall be entered in the sectional index according to the indexing instruction for the specific description and also noted on the margin of the previously recorded instrument, in addition to the general index.
 

(c) Instruments containing blanket descriptions of all land within a stated geographic area without specific description shall be entered in a separate part of the sectional index or in an index of indefinite records or an index of blanket conveyances in addition to the general index.
 

(d) Instruments describing land in irregular sections (all or any part of a section not capable of being divided into quarter sections for indexing purposes) shall be entered in the general index and in an appropriate sectional index maintained by the chancery clerk. The indexing instruction, however, shall be proper and complete if it states no more than the number of the irregular section or sections in which the land is located or, as above provided, in which the land could possibly be located. When an instrument describes land within an irregular section according to officially platted subdivisions or to official surveys or to unofficial subdivisions or surveys commonly in use, it shall be indexed in the sectional index for such subdivisions or surveys.
 

(4) When an instrument has been restored to service from microfilm or other archived record, the chancery clerk shall enter a notation on the margin stating that it is a substituted record and stating the date on which it was restored to service. Such marginal notation shall then constitute notice that the general index must be examined for instruments filed prior to such date which may have been noted on the margin of the original record but do not appear on the margin of the restored record.
 

(5) The clerk of the chancery court shall enter instruments in the sectional index by the end of the twentieth day the office is open following the day on which the instrument is filed, except for records of tax sales.
 

(6) If the chancery clerk elects to abbreviate the names of parties to an instrument in the indices, the clerk shall maintain a list of standard abbreviations used for that purpose and shall adhere to such list.
 

(7) The clerk of the chancery court shall not correct or alter an entry made in any index, whether kept manually or by computer, unless the date and time of the change is clearly disclosed on the revised record.
 

(8) If insufficient space is available for making entries on the margin of a recorded instrument, the chancery clerk may enter on the margin a reference where a continuation sheet is located.
 

(9) Except as expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to modify the requirements of other statutes regarding the duties of the clerk of the chancery court to index and record instruments affecting the title to land.
